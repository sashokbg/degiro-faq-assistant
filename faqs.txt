# How is my money held with DEGIRO?

## Answer
When you open an Investment Account with us, we also open a bank account (Cash Account) in your name at flatexDEGIRO Bank. All of your uninvested money will be held in this separate personal bank account with a personal IBAN.
We do this to make sure that your uninvested money (up to ‚Ç¨100.000) is protected by the German Deposit Guarantee Scheme (Entsch√§digungseinrichtung deutscher Banken).

Your new Cash Account is directly connected to your DEGIRO Investment Account. It is not possible to use this Cash Account for other banking matters, and you will not receive a physical debit card or be able to connect this account to payment services (such as Apple Pay). You can only use it to hold money to finance all the activities on your Investment Account.

# If something happens to DEGIRO, are my investments protected?

## Answer
The flatexDEGIRO Bank Dutch Branch, which operates under the name DEGIRO, is the Dutch branch of flatexDEGIRO Bank AG. flatexDEGIRO Bank AG is primarily supervised by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).

In the Netherlands, flatexDEGIRO Bank Dutch Branch is subject to integrity monitoring by DNB and supervision by the AFM.

The bank is assigned to the Entsch√§digungseinrichtung deutscher Banken GmbH (EdB).

The compensation scheme protects all deposits that are to be shown in the balance sheet item "Liabilities to customers". These include demand, time and savings deposits, including registered savings bonds. These deposits are fully covered up to a total of ‚Ç¨ 100,000 per depositor.

Deposits are also liabilities from securities transactions, provided that the bank's obligation relates to providing the customers with possession or ownership of funds.

For the claim for surrender of securities, the compensation claim is limited to 90% of the liabilities and the equivalent value of a maximum of 20,000 euros.

Securities (shares, bonds, funds or certificates) are not deposits. Rather, they are the property of the customer and are only held in custody for him by flatexDEGIRO Bank and are therefore not at risk even in the event of insolvency.

# Are my investments segregated from the DEGIRO assets?

## Answer
Yes. The safekeeping of your investments is our highest priority.

DEGIRO uses a separate custodian entity to hold your assets, which means they are segregated from the assets of DEGIRO. The sole task of the custodian entity is to administer and safeguard your investments. By law it cannot perform any commercial activities. In the unlikely event that something is to happen to DEGIRO, your investments will not be treated as recoverable assets to DEGIRO's creditors, but will remain safeguarded by the custodian entity.

# How are my investments held?

## Answer
In the financial world there are several methods of holding financial assets. A common method frequently used throughout the financial world is to hold assets on so-called omnibus accounts. This is a type of account on which many different items can be held at the same time, instead of needing a lot of different and separate accounts. These accounts are generally held by a custodian: a bank or other financial institution that holds and keeps (records of) their client's assets.

If you trade financial instruments via DEGIRO, you trade via this omnibus structure. The omnibus accounts that are used to hold your assets are held at our custodian(s) and are kept in the name of 4 different special legal entities, called Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV's), that have the sole purpose of safeguarding and administering your assets. All the shares bought and sold by our clients are debited or credited to the related SPV's account. These SPV's are a specific type of legal entity, called a 'stichting' under Dutch law, which obligates them to act only in accordance with the previously established goal of maintaining and administering your investments and thus prohibits them from engaging in commercial activities. More details about these SPV's can be found in our Client Agreement (most notably Articles 1, 17, and 18) and the ISI - Investment Services.

# What is Market Abuse?
## Answer
Market abuse is unlawful behavior that constitutes insider trading and market manipulation:

Insider trading is trading a company‚Äôs stocks (or derivatives with underlying) with access to confidential or non-public information regarding the company.
Market manipulation is the act of (attempting to) artificially inflate or deflate the price of a security at an abnormal or artificial level or sending misleading signals to the market participants.
Both practices are prohibited by the authorities that supervise financial markets. Such behaviour reduces market transparency, undermines investor confidence and reduces their willingness to participate in the financial markets. It may also impact liquidity in the financial markets.

We are committed to complying with applicable rules and regulations and to maintaining fair and orderly markets. Our goal is to prevent such prohibited practices and to provide a reliable environment in which everyone can trade with confidence. We therefore monitor all orders and transactions, as do the exchanges and regulators, to ensure that orders are properly executed for our clients.

For more information on market abuse, please see the BaFin's website. And for examples of market manipulation, please see here.

# What is two-factor authentication?

## Answer
What is two-factor authentication?
Two-factor authentication - also known as '2FA' - is a way to increase the security of your account by adding a second layer to the login process. Once you've installed it, you will be asked to enter a security code right after you've entered your username and password. This code is requested any time you try to log in from the web-browser and it is requested once when you add a new account to our app.

Why does it matter?

üîê Your investments will be a lot more secure

üîóIt reduces the risk of data theft

üë©‚Äçüíª Less chance of being hacked even if your passwords are compromised.

How can I install it?

Here's how you can install 2FA for your account. It shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes.

Log in to your account on your computer.
Hover your cursor over the profile icon in the bottom-left corner and select 'Personal Settings'.
Next, under 'Security', click on the button that says 'Enable'.
Install a two-factor authentication app such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or any other app like it, and press 'Continue'.
In the 2FA app, add a new account and scan the QR code shown on screen.
Enter the 6-digit code shown in your 2FA app and press enter or the 'Continue' button.
That's it, you have now installed an extra layer of security to your account!
