# How is my money held?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/about-degiro/how-my-money-held

When you become a client of DEGIRO UK, you give a standing order to invest money into a Money Market Fund (MMF). This standing order serves as the cash position you will see in your account. You will be able to use the value of this position to finance your investments.

What is an MMF?

An MMF (also known as a 'cash fund' or 'cash equivalent') is a type of mutual fund that is often used as an alternative to bank accounts due to their high liquidity, stability of value, and short-term investment horizons.

Money Market Funds are often used by institutional investors, such as pension funds, to hold large amounts of money in a safe way. Approximately ‚Ç¨1 trillion is currently being held in Money Market Funds in Europe. The objective of a Money Market Fund is to realize a return that is equal to the market interest rate with as low risk as possible.

With the strict investment policy, the risk for an MMF is very low. According to the Key Investor Information Document¬†(KIID) of the fund, the risk level is a 1 on a scale from 1 to 7. Just like your other investments, your participations in the MMF are kept strictly separate from the assets of DEGIRO.

Why does DEGIRO use MMFs?

We use MMFs instead of Cash Accounts for clients of our UK platform because our European banking license is no longer valid in the UK post-Brexit. Instead of applying for a new UK banking license, using a cash equivalent such as an MMF is a far more suitable solution.

# If something happens to DEGIRO, are my investments protected?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/about-degiro/safeguarded/if-something-happens-degiro-are-my-investments-protected

In the event that something were to happen to DEGIRO, the segregation of client assets ensures that your funds and positions will not be affected. Client assets are held separately from DEGIRO assets, and are not treated as recoverable assets to DEGIRO's creditors. In the event that something happens to DEGIRO, your assets will still belong to you.

In the unlikely event that the segregated assets cannot be returned to clients DEGIRO falls under the German Investor Compensation Scheme, which compensates any losses from non-returned assets up to 90% (with a maximum of ‚Ç¨20,000).

A common misconception is that the ‚Ç¨20,000 cap on the German Investor Compensation Scheme means that if something were to happen to DEGIRO (for example in the case of bankruptcy) investors who hold more than ‚Ç¨20,000 in DEGIRO will lose everything over that amount.

However, this is not the case. Asset segregation is in place to protect client assets in events such as these.The investor protection scheme only comes into effect in the case that DEGIRO is found to have failed to take sufficient measures to protect client assets, or in the case of fraud on the part of DEGIRO.

# How are my investments held?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/about-degiro/safeguarded/how-are-my-investments-held

In the financial world there are several methods of holding financial assets. A common method frequently used throughout the financial world is to hold assets on so-called omnibus accounts. This is a type of account on which many different items can be held at the same time, instead of needing a lot of different and separate accounts. These accounts are generally held by a custodian: a bank or other financial institution that holds and keeps (records of) their client's assets.If you trade financial instruments via DEGIRO, you trade via this omnibus structure.¬†The omnibus accounts that are used to hold your assets are held at our custodian(s) and are kept in the name of 4 different special legal entities, called Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV's), that have the sole purpose of safeguarding and administering your assets. All the shares bought and sold by our clients are debited or credited to the related SPV's account. These SPV's are a specific type of legal entity, called a 'stichting' under Dutch law, which obligates them to act only in accordance with the previously established goal of maintaining and administering your investments and thus prohibits them from engaging in commercial activities. More details about these SPV's can be found in our Client Agreement (most notably Articles 1, 17, and 18) and the ISI - Investment Services.  What does this mean for me?One of the most important consequences of this method of holding financial assets is that an omnibus account can greatly reduce the transaction costs involved in trading on the financial markets. Whereas a structure whereby all the assets are kept on separate accounts would involve many different transactions, and thus more transaction costs, by using the omnibus account all the various transactions made can be aggregated to keep the costs low.

Moreover, because your shares are held by these legal entities, they are separated from flatexDEGIRO's assets. This means that your assets cannot be touched by the creditors looking to settle DEGIRO's debts, should anything happen to DEGIRO. This will guarantee that you will retain the economic rights to these assets if flatexDEGIRO cannot meet its financial obligations.  Related DocumentsClient Agreement

# How are DEGIRO's fees so low?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/about-degiro/history-degiro/how-are-degiros-fees-so-low

DEGIRO offers access trading at exceptionally low costs. We do not consider DEGIRO‚Äôs fees to be low, rather that other brokers are needlessly expensive

In 2013, DEGIRO launched retail services and brought a platform built for professional investors to the public. Unlike with other brokers, our fees for retail investors remained as low as the fees for the professionals. Making use of the latest technology, our in-house developed trading platform strives toward efficiently executing your orders, saving costs on every transaction. With millions of transactions every year, we pass these cost savings on to our clients.

# Who is DEGIRO?

Since then, DEGIRO has expanded across 18 European countries enabling retail investors to benefit from a highly competitive commission structure. As a result, DEGIRO has quickly become one of the largest brokers in Europe.

# Are my investments segregated from the DEGIRO assets?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/about-degiro/safeguarded/are-my-investments-segregated-degiro-assets

Yes. The safekeeping of your investments is our highest priority.

DEGIRO uses a separate custodian entity to hold your assets, which means they are segregated from the assets of DEGIRO. The sole task of the custodian entity is to administer and safeguard your investments. By law it cannot perform any commercial activities. In the unlikely event that something is to happen to DEGIRO, your investments will not be treated as recoverable assets to DEGIRO's creditors, but will remain safeguarded by the custodian entity.

# How can I enable two-step authentication on my account?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/account-and-personal-details/how-can-i-enable-two-step-authentication-my-account

What is two-factor authentication?

Two-factor authentication - also known as '2FA' - is a way to increase the security of your account by adding a second layer to the login process. Once you've installed it, you will be asked to enter a security code right after you've entered your username and password. This code is requested any time you try to log in from the web-browser and it is requested once when you add a new account to our app.

Why does it matter?

üîê Your investments will be a lot more secure

üîóIt reduces the risk of data theft

üë©‚Äçüíª Less chance of being hacked even if your passwords are compromised.

How can I install it?

Here's how you can install 2FA for your account. It shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes.

Log in¬†to your account on your computer.
	Hover your cursor over the profile icon in the bottom-left corner and select 'Personal Settings'.
	Next, under 'Security', click on the button that says 'Enable'.
	Install a two-factor authentication app such as¬†Google Authenticator,¬†Microsoft Authenticator, or any other app like it, and press 'Continue'.
	In the 2FA app, add a new account and scan the QR code shown on screen.
	Enter the 6-digit code shown in your 2FA app and press enter or the 'Continue' button.
That's it, you have now installed an extra layer of security to your account! Can I set up two-factor authentication on more than one device?That depends on the app you use to generate the 2FA code. For example, as far as we know,¬†Google Authenticator¬†has an export function that lets you share 2FA links across devices whereas¬†Microsoft Authenticator¬†does not. A quick search online should give you the answer.  What should I do if I no longer have access to the device with my security code?If you no longer have access to the device that generates the security code, the two-factor authentication has to be manually disabled. You can then login using only your username and password and re-install the 2FA. To disable the two-factor authentication, please¬†call our Service Desk.  I get a 'code incorrect' error, what should I do?The 'code incorrect' error usually shows up in two scenarios:

The code entered on your computer does not match the code for the account in the 2FA app.
	The time settings of your device are incorrect.
For the first scenario, the obvious first thing to do is to be absolutely sure that you are entering the right code for the right account. Although it seems simple enough, sometimes the code generated by your device is for an old link to the same account. This can happen if you have disabled the 2FA from your DEGIRO account, but forgot to remove it from your 2FA app as well. Whenever the 2FA is disabled for your DEGIRO account, it is good to remove it from the app as well as to avoid confusion later on.

Another common issue is when the time settings on your device are not correct. This should be fixed by updating the time settings from either your device's settings, or the settings in the 2FA app.  Do I need two-factor authentication for the app as well?You will only need the 2FA code when you add a new account to the DEGIRO app. When you've logged into that account via our app once, the 2FA code will not be requested again.

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/fees/trading-fees/are-there-fees-trading-another-currency

Yes, trading in or with foreign currencies comes with a conversion cost. However, how much a given trade in or with a foreign currency will cost depends on whether you have enabled automatic currency conversion (AutoFX).

You can find the exact fees for both types of conversion in our¬†Fee Schedule.

To help you invest in a well-diversified portfolio, we offer a wide range of carefully selected exchange traded funds (ETFs) for which the commission fees are on the house¬†so long as your trade is in line with our¬†fair use policy.

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/fees/other-costs/what-do-implicit-transaction-costs-annual-costs-and-charges-statement-mean

Implicit transaction costs show the cost of the bid-ask spread. These are external costs that depend on the difference between the middle price and the spread during order execution and do not arise from DEGIRO.

DEGIRO is required to display the implicit transaction costs in the Annual Costs and Charges Statement. The implicit transaction costs are the difference between the price at which your order was executed and the middle price between the bid and ask prices at the time of execution.

These are not separate costs that have been charged but are included in the purchase price of your shares. DEGIRO has no influence on these costs.

# Can I trade on margin from DEGIRO?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/trading-margin/can-i-trade-margin-degiro

Yes, it is possible to trade on margin from DEGIRO. This service is referred to as Debit Money.

Trading on margin involves investing more than the cash value held in your Cash Account. When trading on margin from DEGIRO, your Cash Account will be negative. With the Active profile, a more conservative approach to calculating portfolio risk is taken. This means you will have less available margin.

With the Trader profile, a less conservative approach to portfolio risk is taken. The Trader profile allows you to trade with more margin from DEGIRO, however this carries greater risk.

For full information please see the document Debit Money Conditions.

# What is Allocation and how does it work?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/what-allocation-and-how-does-it-work

When you‚Äôre using Margin Loan (Debit Money), your cash balance is negative, and standard interest of 6.90% is being charged.

By allocating an amount, you are basically announcing your intention to use that amount as Margin Loan (Debit Money) in the coming calendar month. This gives us time to prepare and plan accordingly. In return, you get the reduced interest rate of 5.25%.

For a detailed overview of costs and charges, see our¬†Fee Schedule. How to add an allocationLog in to your account, go to the Settings page, and select Allocation. Note that these settings are only visible if you have an Active, Trader, or Intraday account type. Once you‚Äôre¬†on¬†the Allocation page¬†in the trading platform, select Add allocation.¬†The newly added allocation will take effect of on the first day of the following calendar month unless you remove it or edit it before that.¬†You can add an allocation in your account's default currency, but if you have Manual FX enabled, you can add allocations in foreign currencies as well.How to remove or edit an allocationYou can see the allocation for the current calendar month under Current allocation. To remove an active allocation, use the pencil icon and set the amount to zero. You can also change the allocation in the same way by setting it to the desired amount. Adjustments will be seen under New allocation. The removal or change of the allocation will take effect on the first day of the following calendar month.Important to know

Allocation is an ongoing service. Once you add or edit an allocation, it will remain in place unless you remove it or edit it again.
	An allocation will be applicable for a minimum of a full calendar month. Adding, editing, or removing an allocation will take effect on the first day of the following calendar month.
	The interest is always charged on the entire amount allocated, whether it is used or not.
	If in one calendar month, you end up using more Margin Loan (Debit Money) than you have allocated for that month, standard interest rate will be charged on the amount exceeding the allocation.
	In case you have allocated more than we can currently lend you, you‚Äôll be charged interest on the full amount you have allocated, even when you don‚Äôt currently have that amount of Margin Loan (Debit Money) at your disposal.
	It is not possible to allocate more than 9x of your current net liquidity.
	As merely a way of announcing your intention to use a certain amount of Margin Loan (Debit Money), allocating will not increase your cash balance nor grant you more margin. The actual margin available to you depends on factors such as value and composition of your portfolio. For details, consult our¬†Investment Portfolio Risk Handbook.
	If you want to add an allocation in a foreign currency, Manual FX must be enabled for that currency. Learn more about¬†Currency conversion settings.
	The existing Margin Loan (Debit Money) amount you have in a foreign currency cash account will be converted to the account default currency once you activate Auto FX again. However, our allocation in a foreign currency will stay in place, so you might need to adjust it manually.

# Can I make a transfer in another currency?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/can-i-make-transfer-another-currency

# What does a Cash sweep mean?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/deposits-and-withdrawals/what-does-cash-sweep-mean

Daily cash sweeps are administrative transfers between your personal flatexDEGIRO cash account and your DEGIRO account. At the end of each business day, a calculation is made to determine if more money has been received on your DEGIRO account, or if more money has been spent.

For example, if you have bought shares for a higher amount than sold, an administrative booking (cash sweep) will take place from your personal cash account to your DEGIRO account. If you have sold shares for a higher amount than purchased, the difference will be transferred to your personal cash account by means of an administrative booking (cash sweep) from your DEGIRO account.

The daily cash sweeps are visible in the account statement by turning off the slider at 'Hide cash movements‚Äô.

# How many bank accounts can I link to my investment account?

# I am trading on margin and now my account is in deficit. What should I do?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/trading-margin/i-am-trading-margin-and-now-my-account-deficit-what

Your Available to Trade amount is the sum of your Cash Account, cash held in other currencies, and your available margin. If this value becomes negative, you have exceeded your available margin from DEGIRO.In this case, please either close an open position(s)¬†or make a deposit to your DEGIRO account to cover the deficit.

If the deficit results in a Margin Call from DEGIRO, our Risk department will contact you giving you a deadline to clear the deficit.

Please take into account that market movements can increase/decrease your deficit before the deadline is reached.Additionally, when making a deposit, please keep in mind that it can take up to 3 working days for us to receive and allocate your deposit. If you do not think that your funds will reach your DEGIRO account before your deadline, please send a Proof of Payment to our Risk Department at risk@degiro.nl.

Your Proof of Payment should contain all the following details in one document:

Your full name
	Your sort code and account number
	DEGIRO's sort code and account number
	Transfer date
	Transfer amount
Once the Proof of Payment is received by our Risk Department and you have received a confirmation from DEGIRO that your proof has been accepted, your Margin Call will be resolved. However, the Margin Call task will remain visible on the platform until the deposit has been received and the deficit resolved.

Please be aware that sending a Proof of Payment does not guarantee that your proof will be accepted. Our Risk Department can still reject the provided proof if¬† the proof is not sufficient.

Additionally, please ensure you send your Proof of Payment well before the deadline from the email address linked to your DEGIRO account. Received Proof of Payments will be checked and approved by the Risk Department on a best effort basis.Please be aware that if we do not receive this Proof of Payment within a reasonable time before the deadline set for your Margin Call, the Risk Department may not take the proof into account and will start closing some of your positions. DEGIRO will apply charges to close these positions.

More information regarding our margin system and the deficit procedure can be found in Security Value, Risk Debit Money and Debit Securities document and in the Investment Portfolio Risk Handbook. These documents along with the Client Agreement are available at our Helpcentre.

# What is the order duration?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/what-order-duration

When placing an order, you select whether you want the duration to be a Day order or GTC (Good-Till-Cancelled).

A Day order will stay open until it is executed during the trading day, or until the relevant market closes. If the order is not executed by the end of the trading day of the relevant market, the order will be deleted automatically.

A GTC (Good-till-Cancelled) order, on the other hand, will roll over into the next trading day if the order is not executed by the end of the trading day. The way GTC orders are handled will depend on the trading venue. For example, orders placed on Euronext will be valid for one year while orders placed on US exchanges will be valid for 90 days. However, there is no guarantee that the order will not be cancelled for other reasons such as a corporate action of the underlying company, or that the market price has moved too far from the set limit price of your order. For this reason, you should monitor the status of your open orders.

# What is the difference between a stop loss order and a stop limit order?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/what-difference-between-stop-loss-order-and-stop-limit-order

Stop Loss orders are designed to limit your loss if a share that you hold falls in price. As soon as the price of a share reaches your Stop price this triggers a Market order to be sent to the place of execution. Dependent on the place of execution, this order type is offered by the exchange or simulated in the IT systems of DEGIRO. In the latter case, this is on a best-effort basis.

Once your Stop Loss is reached, and a market order is triggered, this market order will be executed even if the price of the stock in question subsequently rises above your Stop Loss.

Likewise, when you have a short position, you can place a Stop Loss order to limit your losses if the share price rises. The Stop price becomes the price at which you will start buying back your short position.

In most situations, the last price is used as a trigger, but it can also be that the bid price and ask prices can be used when there is no last price. To avoid bad executions at unfavourable prices, for some product segments the stop loss will not be released when market maker quotes are not in the market or not visible. On the Products& Markets page, you can find what products this may apply to.

A Stop Limit order is a Stop Loss order that, instead of a Market order, generates a Limit order when your chosen 'stop loss' price is reached. In the case of a sell order, your Stop Limit should be below your Stop Loss. In the event that the trading price of the product falls below your Stop Limit, a sell order will not be executed. with this type of order, the buy or sell transaction will not be executed for a worse price than your chosen limit.

Please refer to the Orders and Order Execution Policy¬†document in our Document Centre for more information.

You can learn more about order types in our Investor Academy.

# What are the different order types?

# Why has my order has been rejected?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/why-has-my-order-has-been-rejected

There are a number of reasons why an order might not be accepted. DEGIRO offers access to exchanges worldwide, each with varying rules of acceptability for an order to be eligible for execution.

Some common reasons why an order is not accepted can include (but is not limited to):

Price Limit: Many exchanges set a range of acceptability and will reject an order in the case that the order price exceeds this band. This is to prevent excess volatile movements in the price of securities. As such, an order can be rejected in the case that the limit price is too high or too low compared to the last traded price.

Worst-Case Execution Scenario: If your market order has been rejected this may be because the worst-case execution scenario exceeds your available to trade amount. As the price of a market order is not set until the order is executed, we must account for a sudden change in price in the time from the order being placed to the time of execution. If this seems to be the issue then you may wish to either reduce the quantity of the market order or place a limit order, where the maximum execution price will be less than your available to trade.

Incorrect Stop Price: Stop Loss and Stop Limit orders are intended to trigger at a certain point after a fall in stock price. As such, when entering a Stop price, it must be lower than the current trading price of the security.

Tick Size: Some products set a fixed tick size for the minimum movement in the price. An order may be rejected if this price limit is not met. For instance; if a stock requires all prices to be set to a tick size to the nearest ‚Ç¨0.02, an order for ‚Ç¨0.35 would be rejected. In essence, the limit price set must be divisible by the tick size.

Lot Size: Some exchanges require stocks to be purchased in allotments of¬†certain amounts such as 1,000, 10,000, etc. This is particularly common in Asian markets.

DEGIRO suggests familiarising yourself with the rules and conditions of the exchange before you start trading.

# Does DEGIRO offer fractional shares?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/does-degiro-offer-fractional-shares

We do not offer trading in fractional shares on our platform. We only facilitate trading in whole shares.

# How do I place an order?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/placing-order/how-do-i-place-order

All orders can be placed using the trading platform (Webtrader, Android or iOS app).

You can reach the order window in several ways:
1.) Go to your favourites. If there are products added to this list already, you can reach the order window by clicking the buy or sell buttons next to the name.
2.) Click on the Buy or Sell button on the product detail page of the specific product.
3.) Click on the Plus symbol (right upper corner in Webtrader, left lower corner in App), search for product and choose it.

You can also place an order by clicking on the desired price on the product's pricing chart. It will then automatically open the order window and select a limit order with this limit.

# Why was a transaction executed without my confirmation?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/execution-policy/why-was-transaction-executed-without-my-confirmation

If you see that a transaction has taken place without your knowledge or consent, this is usually due to the processing of a (mandatory) corporate action. Examples of such events are ISIN or name changes or (reverse) stock splits.

Whenever a corporate action takes place, we process it through a simultaneous purchase and sale for the relevant financial instrument. You can recognize such a transaction by the fact that it takes place at the same time (e.g., at 00:00:00) and that the transaction is for the same amount. If you navigate to "Inbox" and then "Account statement", you will see the reason for the transaction in the description.

In short, these transactions are not 'real' transactions, but rather administrative bookings.

If you want to find out more about the specific corporate action, you can usually find the necessary information on the (news page of the) company's investor relations website.

# What is an Order ID and where can I find it?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/order-issues/what-order-id-and-where-can-i-find-it

What is an Order ID?

An Order ID is a unique identifier for each order you place on our trading platform. The Order ID is used by our Brokerage department to process and identify each individual order. When an order cannot be processed because it is rejected by the exchange, for example, we will email you the Order ID of the order that could not be processed. You can use this Order ID to find the rejected order in your account and, if desired, place a new (similar) order.How do I find my Order ID in my account in the app?

Tap on 'Inbox', in the bottom right corner of your screen and tap on 'Orders'.
	Select 'History' and select the correct start and end dates.
	Tap on the order for which you want to see the Order ID.
This will open the order information window, which will include the Order ID.

How do I find my Order ID in my account in the platform?

In the menu on the left hand side of the screen, hover over 'Inbox' and click on 'Orders'.

This will open the order information window, which will include the Order ID.

# What is the difference between a limit order and a market order?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/what-difference-between-limit-order-and-market-order

With a Market order, you place an order to execute your transaction at the current best available price. There is no upper bound on this price. With less liquid products, you may receive a worse price than what you anticipated. We therefore strongly advise you to treat this type of order with care.

With a Limit Order you set a minimum price (in case of a sell) or maximum price (in case of a buy) for which you want to execute your order. Your order will never be executed at a worse price than your limit price. If the price that you have stated is not attainable at that time, your order will be sent to the place of execution at which the best-price execution is expected.

Please refer to the Orders and Order Execution Policy¬†document in our Document Centre for more information.

You can learn more about order types in our Investor Academy.

# I want to buy shares on the London Stock Exchange, but the value is in GBX, what does this mean?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/placing-order/i-want-buy-shares-london-stock-exchange-value-gbx-what-does-mean

Many stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange trade against GBX (penny sterling). That is a policy of the London Stock Exchange.
At DEGIRO, this currency is automatically converted back to GBP (pound sterling) because the Morgan Stanley money market fund does not offer holdings against the GBX.
In the account statement it also shows that there is paid for the shares in GBX where 1 GBX = 0.01 GBP.

# What are subscription rights and how can I exercise them?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/my-portfolio/what-are-subscription-rights-and-how-can-i-exercise-them

Shareholders may receive subscription rights when a company plans to raise capital through a rights issue. A rights issue allows shareholders to buy new shares of the company at a predetermined subscription price, usually lower than the current market price. Investors who are eligible to receive the rights will receive them in their account before market opening on the ex-date, the cut-off date of stock ownership to be eligible to receive the rights, or the first trading day, if applicable.Companies can issue renounceable rights, which allows investors to trade the subscription rights on the exchange. In this case, investors who do not have shares in the company can trade the subscription rights and/or participate in the rights issue. Companies can also issue non-renounceable rights, in which case investors cannot trade the subscription rights on any exchange.

If you have received rights from a rights issue or bought rights on the exchange,¬†please be aware that if you do not close your position on or before the last trading day or exercise your rights before the deadline, the rights will usually expire worthless.

DEGIRO will inform clients who have received rights from a rights issue via e-mail, including the details of the corporate action and instructions on how to subscribe to the rights. If you received rights and did not receive an e-mail from us, or if you have a related question, you can contact our Corporate Actions team at¬†ca@degiro.com

For more information on corporate actions, such as rights issues, you can consult the relevant company‚Äôs Investor relations page. Please note that a subscription deadline at DEGIRO may differ from the market deadline mentioned in the right issue‚Äôs prospectus.

# What is Smart Order Routing (SOR)?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/what-smart-order-routing-sor

To help a client receive the best execution on their order and efficiently access liquidity, financial institutions sometimes make use of what is known as 'smart order routing'. A Smart Order Router (SOR) is an automatic system of order routing that monitors all the trading venues to which it is connected where the product which you would like to trade is available. It will scan all these venues for the best available opposite order to your buy or sell order.

Because of the many different trading venues on which the same product can be traded, the bid and ask prices (and corresponding volumes) of that product tend to vary across venues. The SOR helps to make sure that your order is being screened against the activity on all these venues, so that you might get the best execution on your order.

The Smart Order Router always uses a reference venue to compare all the orders on the alternative venues. A reference venue is the main venue where the product is being traded. This is often a well-known exchange such as Euronext Amsterdam, The London Stock Exchange (main segment), or the New York Stock Exchange.

For more information, visit¬†What is a trading venue?¬†and refer to our Best Execution reports and ISI - Order Execution Policy.¬†On¬†this page, you can find an overview of the markets for which the SOR is available.

# How to place an order for a bond.

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/how-place-order-bond

Placing a buy or sell order for a corporate or government bond is different from placing an order for a stock or ETF. Due to the nature of¬†how bonds work, when investing in bonds you do not specify the amount of bonds you would like to buy or sell and how much you are willing to pay or receive for each - as is the case for stocks and ETFs.

Instead, you specify how much money you would like to have invested in a bond (the nominal value) and how much you are willing to pay for that investment expressed in a percentage of the bond's par value (the limit price). When determining the price for a bond, you are thus essentially answering the question of how much you are willing to over or underpay to receive a specified amount of money. This is because the intrinsic value of a bond is generally a given, since it consists of the par value that will be returned to the bond holder upon maturity plus the coupon payments during the bond's lifetime.  Different order typesWhen placing an order for a bond, you have the option of entering four different order types: a limit order, a market order, a stoploss order, and a stoplimit order. The main difference between these order types is whether or not you determine a fixed maximum (or minimum) price that you are willing to pay (or receive) for your order. If you choose a market or stoploss order, you do not specify this price and will only determine how much nominal value you want to invest or receive. For more information, see What is the difference between a limit order and a market order?¬†and What is the difference between a stop loss order and a stop limit order?  Good to know¬†Although bond prices are generally a percentage of the par value, our platform will express them in a monetary value. There is no practical difference between these two ways of pricing since 100% of ‚Ç¨100 is ‚Ç¨100.

# What happens if a position I hold is delisted?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/what-happens-if-position-i-hold-delisted

Account balanceThe total value of your account. It represents the balance on your cash account and the total value of all the positions in your portfolio (the value of your investments plus your cash).  EUR/GBP/CHFThis is the current balance on the cash account. If this value is negative, this means that you are borrowing money from us to finance your investments. The interest for this loan depends on whether or not the loan has been allocated beforehand. Please refer to our¬†Feeschedule¬†for more information on these fees.

# In what currency are dividends paid?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/what-currency-are-dividends-paid

When a company chooses to issue dividends - that is, profits that are being paid out to shareholders - the company decides not only how much the dividends will be, but also in what currency they'll be paid. They can choose to pay the dividends in only one currency (for example, only in Euros) or in more than one currency (for example, in British Pounds and Euros).

Sometimes, you'll see that the dividends you receive from a position are being paid in a different currency from that in which your position is held. At first glance, this might seem¬†inconsistent. However, it is not a hard-and-fast rule that both currencies have to match. This is because the currency of the dividend does not depend on the currency of the share's listing. Ultimately, it is up to the discretion of the company to determine which currency they wish to pay their dividends in.

When you receive dividends in a foreign currency, they will automatically be converted to your base currency unless you have turned on Manual FX for that currency. In this case, the currency will be booked directly to your foreign currency account.

How it works for ETFs¬†and investment funds

Since ETFs and investment funds may receive dividends from companies in different currencies, the issuer of the ETF/investment fund decides how it will handle the dividends. This is called the dividend policy and is disclosed by the¬†issuer¬†of the product. For more information, please refer to the prospectus of each ETF/investment fund¬†and/or other documentation published by the issuer of that¬†product.

# How do I search for a product?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/using-trading-platform/how-do-i-search-product

In the top left-hand corner of the Trader, you will find the search box. Here you can search for products to trade. You can search for a stock by name, ticker symbol, or ISIN code. In the App, you find the search by clicking on the "Search" symbol below in the menu bar.

Products can be found using the name, the ISIN and the ticker code, as long as the ticker code contains more than three characters. The ticker code is unique to a product on an exchange. ISIN stands for International Securities Identification Number and identifies tradable securities by their unique code. Different listings of the same product on different exchanges will have the same ISIN.

# Why do some products and exchanges show no price data?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/why-do-some-products-and-exchanges-show-no-price-data

We do not currently offer price feeds for some exchanges including (but not limited to): Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. If a price feed is missing, you can still place orders on these products, but you may wish to obtain the price information from a third party data provider.

# What is 'Bid Only'?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/what-bid-only

Sometimes, a structured product, such as a turbo or warrant, does not have an 'ask' price. In such cases, it's in a so-called 'Bid Only' status. This can occur when the product is sold out or when the maximum leverage allowed by local regulators has been exceeded.

Whenever a product is in this 'Bid Only' status, the issuer or liquidity provider (market maker) can no longer offer to sell (more of) these products to the market. The issuer will therefore not show any 'ask' prices and will only show 'bid' prices at which it¬†offers¬†to buy back any products.

For more information about the status and price information of a particular product, please consult the issuer's or exchange's website.

# How to transfer my DEGIRO portfolio to another broker?

# What do the suffixes "ACC" or "DIST" behind an ETF mean?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/what-do-suffixes-acc-or-dist-behind-etf-mean

The suffixes "ACC" and "DIST" behind an ETF's name are shorthand for "Accumulating" and "Distributing". This is an indication of the two different ways of how an ETF can manage the dividends it generates.

For more information on the difference between these two ways of handling dividends, please visit the¬†product page for ETFs in our Knowledge Center.

# Can I trade on the London Stock Exchange AIM Segment?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/can-i-trade-london-stock-exchange-aim-segment

Through DEGIRO you can trade in LSE AIM stocks, however there are a few points to consider before starting to trade AIM stocks.

The Alternative Investment Market, or AIM, was launched with the purpose of allowing smaller companies to gain a listing on a stock exchange without the entry and regulatory requirements of the main LSE. The FTSE AIM works differently than the main market.

The London Stock Exchange offers three trading services for equity securities.

The SETS is the primary order book for large cap LSE stocks and some of the more liquid AIM stocks. It features a full electronic order book with executable quotes and centralised clearing.

The SETSqx trading service is more commonly used for less liquid or smaller companies. SETqx listed products do not offer continuous trading as SETS products but rather trade via four intra-day electronic order book auctions scheduled at 9am, 11am, 2pm, and 4:35pm. Stocks can also trade OTC (over-the-counter) by individual market makers outside of these auction times.Please note		You cannot participate in the SETSqx auctions via our platform; your orders will always be sent to the market makers instead of the exchange since liquidity is generally very low during these auctions. The price information shown in your Trading Platform does, however, reflect the prices from the auction. You will thus see the prices from the auction, but you will not trade directly against these prices. The prices in your Trading Platform thus serve as an indicator of the current market value of the product, but are no guarantee that you will receive execution against these prices.	The SEAQ (Stock Exchange Automated Quotation system) is a non-electronic executable quote service where market makers provide AIM stock quotes. The system has no publicly available order book and trades conducted in a quote driven market traded OTC.

DEGIRO recommends that potential investors inform themselves of the specifics of each trading service before trading on the AIM exchange, as liquidity can be limited, information may not be publicly available, and trades may be conducted off book and outside of auction times, despite other open orders in the market at the time. You can find on which trading service each security trades on the London Stock Exchange website.

For more information, DEGIRO recommends reading the LSE's document on trading services.

The information presented above is intended to provide basic information in relation to the FTSE AIM market and should not be considered to be trading advice. DEGIRO accept no responsibility in any inaccuracies or incorrect information. All trading carries risks and investors should remain knowledgeable about the products and markets they are trading in. Further information can be obtained by referring to the London Stock Exchange website.

# How do I short sell?

## https://degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/how-do-i-short-sell

With an Active, Trader or Day Trader profile you can hold a short position at DEGIRO. This service is called Debit Securities.

If you do not yet have an Active, Trader or Day Trader profile, you first need to change your Basic account to one of the above profiles. You can find these settings in the 'Trading settings' section of your profile. You will then need to complete two appropriateness tests and sign the additional terms and conditions.

To enter into a short position on your Active or Trader account, place a sell order in a product that you do not currently own. It is not possible to have both a short position and a long position in the same product. If you place a sell order on a product that you currently have a long position in, your existing shares will be sold.

Please note that it is not possible to go from a long to a short position with one order. You will first have to close the long position for a given product, after which you can enter into a short position for that same product.

Securities available for short selling include ETFs and stocks from the main indices on the following exchanges: Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels, Euronext Paris, Xetra, Bolsa de Madrid, London Stock Exchange and the Swiss Stock Exchange.

It is not possible to go short on US securities and risk category D products. If you try to go short on these products, you will receive an error message.

The maximum size of your potential short position is determined by your allocated margin based on our risk model. For more information regarding our risk model, please see the documents below. You will find the corresponding percentages per risk category¬†here.
