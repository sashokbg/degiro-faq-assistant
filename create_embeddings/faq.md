# If something happens to DEGIRO, are my investments protected?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/about-degiro/safeguarded/if-something-happens-degiro-are-my-investments-protected

In the event that something were to happen to DEGIRO, the segregation of client assets ensures that your funds and positions will not be affected. Client assets are held separately from DEGIRO assets, and are not treated as recoverable assets to DEGIRO's creditors. In the event that something happens to DEGIRO, your assets will still belong to you.
In the unlikely event that the segregated assets cannot be returned to clients DEGIRO falls under the German Investor Compensation Scheme, which compensates any losses from non-returned assets up to 90% (with a maximum of ‚Ç¨20,000).
A common misconception is that the ‚Ç¨20,000 cap on the German Investor Compensation Scheme means that if something were to happen to DEGIRO (for example in the case of bankruptcy) investors who hold more than ‚Ç¨20,000 in DEGIRO will lose everything over that amount.
However, this is not the case. Asset segregation is in place to protect client assets in events such as these. The investor protection scheme only comes into effect in the case that DEGIRO is found to have failed to take sufficient measures to protect client assets, or in the case of fraud on the part of DEGIRO.

# How is my money held?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/about-degiro/how-my-money-held

When you become a client of DEGIRO UK, you give a standing order to invest money into a Money Market Fund (MMF). This standing order serves as the cash position you will see in your account. You will be able to use the value of this position to finance your investments.
What is an MMF?
An MMF (also known as a 'cash fund' or 'cash equivalent') is a type of mutual fund that is often used as an alternative to bank accounts due to their high liquidity, stability of value, and short-term investment horizons.
Money Market Funds are often used by institutional investors, such as pension funds, to hold large amounts of money in a safe way. Approximately ‚Ç¨1 trillion is currently being held in Money Market Funds in Europe. The objective of a Money Market Fund is to realize a return that is equal to the market interest rate with as low risk as possible.
With the strict investment policy, the risk for an MMF is very low. According to the Key Investor Information Document¬†(KIID) of the fund, the risk level is a 1 on a scale from 1 to 7. Just like your other investments, your participations in the MMF are kept strictly separate from the assets of DEGIRO.
Why does DEGIRO use MMFs?
We use MMFs instead of Cash Accounts for clients of our UK platform because our European banking license is no longer valid in the UK post-Brexit. Instead of applying for a new UK banking license, using a cash equivalent such as an MMF is a far more suitable solution.

# How are my investments held?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/about-degiro/safeguarded/how-are-my-investments-held

In the financial world there are several methods of holding financial assets. A common method frequently used throughout the financial world is to hold assets on so-called omnibus accounts. This is a type of account on which many different items can be held at the same time, instead of needing a lot of different and separate accounts. These accounts are generally held by a custodian: a bank or other financial institution that holds and keeps (records of) their client's assets. If you trade financial instruments via DEGIRO, you trade via this omnibus structure.¬†The omnibus accounts that are used to hold your assets are held at our custodian(s) and are kept in the name of 4 different special legal entities, called Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV's), that have the sole purpose of safeguarding and administering your assets. All the shares bought and sold by our clients are debited or credited to the related SPV's account. These SPV's are a specific type of legal entity, called a 'stichting' under Dutch law, which obligates them to act only in accordance with the previously established goal of maintaining and administering your investments and thus prohibits them from engaging in commercial activities. More details about these SPV's can be found in our Client Agreement (most notably Articles 1, 17, and 18) and the ISI - Investment Services. What does this mean for me? One of the most important consequences of this method of holding financial assets is that an omnibus account can greatly reduce the transaction costs involved in trading on the financial markets. Whereas a structure whereby all the assets are kept on separate accounts would involve many different transactions, and thus more transaction costs, by using the omnibus account all the various transactions made can be aggregated to keep the costs low.
Moreover, because your shares are held by these legal entities, they are separated from flatexDEGIRO's assets. This means that your assets cannot be touched by the creditors looking to settle DEGIRO's debts, should anything happen to DEGIRO. This will guarantee that you will retain the economic rights to these assets if flatexDEGIRO cannot meet its financial obligations. Related Documents Client Agreement

# Are my investments segregated from the DEGIRO assets?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/about-degiro/safeguarded/are-my-investments-segregated-degiro-assets

Yes. The safekeeping of your investments is our highest priority.
DEGIRO uses a separate custodian entity to hold your assets, which means they are segregated from the assets of DEGIRO. The sole task of the custodian entity is to administer and safeguard your investments. By law it cannot perform any commercial activities. In the unlikely event that something is to happen to DEGIRO, your investments will not be treated as recoverable assets to DEGIRO's creditors, but will remain safeguarded by the custodian entity.

# How can I enable two-step authentication on my account?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/account-and-personal-details/how-can-i-enable-two-step-authentication-my-account

What is two-factor authentication?
Two-factor authentication - also known as '2FA' - is a way to increase the security of your account by adding a second layer to the login process. Once you've installed it, you will be asked to enter a security code right after you've entered your username and password. This code is requested any time you try to log in from the web-browser and it is requested once when you add a new account to our app.
Why does it matter?
üîê Your investments will be a lot more secure
üîóIt reduces the risk of data theft
üë©‚Äçüíª Less chance of being hacked even if your passwords are compromised.
How can I install it?
Here's how you can install 2FA for your account. It shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes.
Log in¬†to your account on your computer.
Hover your cursor over the profile icon in the bottom-left corner and select 'Personal Settings'.
Next, under 'Security', click on the button that says 'Enable'.
Install a two-factor authentication app such as¬†Google Authenticator,¬†Microsoft Authenticator, or any other app like it, and press 'Continue'.
In the 2FA app, add a new account and scan the QR code shown on screen.
Enter the 6-digit code shown in your 2FA app and press enter or the 'Continue' button.
That's it, you have now installed an extra layer of security to your account! Can I set up two-factor authentication on more than one device? That depends on the app you use to generate the 2FA code. For example, as far as we know,¬†Google Authenticator¬†has an export function that lets you share 2FA links across devices whereas¬†Microsoft Authenticator¬†does not. A quick search online should give you the answer. What should I do if I no longer have access to the device with my security code? If you no longer have access to the device that generates the security code, the two-factor authentication has to be manually disabled. You can then login using only your username and password and re-install the 2FA. To disable the two-factor authentication, please¬†call our Service Desk. I get a 'code incorrect' error, what should I do? The 'code incorrect' error usually shows up in two scenarios:
The code entered on your computer does not match the code for the account in the 2FA app.
The time settings of your device are incorrect.
For the first scenario, the obvious first thing to do is to be absolutely sure that you are entering the right code for the right account. Although it seems simple enough, sometimes the code generated by your device is for an old link to the same account. This can happen if you have disabled the 2FA from your DEGIRO account, but forgot to remove it from your 2FA app as well. Whenever the 2FA is disabled for your DEGIRO account, it is good to remove it from the app as well as to avoid confusion later on.
Another common issue is when the time settings on your device are not correct. This should be fixed by updating the time settings from either your device's settings, or the settings in the 2FA app. Do I need two-factor authentication for the app as well? You will only need the 2FA code when you add a new account to the DEGIRO app. When you've logged into that account via our app once, the 2FA code will not be requested again.

# Are there fees for trading in another currency?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/fees/trading-fees/are-there-fees-trading-another-currency

Yes, trading in or with foreign currencies comes with a conversion cost. However, how much a given trade in or with a foreign currency will cost depends on whether you have enabled automatic currency conversion (AutoFX).
You can find the exact fees for both types of conversion in our¬†Fee Schedule.
When a currency conversion occurs on your account, you will see the entries FX Credit and FX Withdrawal in your Account Statement. These entries are not fees, but a reflection of how the foreign currency transaction is booked in your base currency.

# Where can I find the fees for trading with DEGIRO? Are there any hidden fees?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/fees/trading-fees/where-can-i-find-fees-trading-degiro-are-there-any-hidden-fees

All fees that DEGIRO charges can be found on the Fee Schedule and Custody Fee Schedule. DEGIRO is fully transparent about our fees. There are no fees which do not appear on our fee schedule; there are no inactivity fees, nor is there a minimum trading amount imposed on account holders.

# Are there any costs for depositing or withdrawing funds?

# What is the Exchange Connection Fee?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/fees/trading-fees/what-exchange-connection-fee

However, all costs related to establishing the connection with your home exchange are on us. So, for Ireland, this means that the connection to Euronext Dublin is free of charge.
Check our¬†Fees page¬†and¬†Fee Schedule¬†for more information.

# Why are there commission fees charged for an ETF from the ETF core selection list?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/fees/trading-fees/why-are-there-commission-fees-charged-etf-etf-core-selection-list

If you have been charged with commission fees for an ETF that is part of the Core Selection, this is probably because not all of the conditions of the fair use policy have been met or because the ETF you have purchased or sold was listed on a different exchange than the one from the Core Selection
To help you invest in a well-diversified portfolio, we offer a wide range of carefully selected exchange traded funds (ETFs) for which the commission fees are on the house¬†so long as your trade is in line with our¬†fair use policy.
If you are need any assistance, do not hesitate to¬†contact¬†our Service Desk. *Only commission fees are exempted. Handling fees, currency, connectivity, and external product costs may apply.

# What do implicit transaction costs in the Annual Costs and Charges Statement mean?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/fees/other-costs/what-do-implicit-transaction-costs-annual-costs-and-charges-statement-mean

Implicit transaction costs show the cost of the bid-ask spread. These are external costs that depend on the difference between the middle price and the spread during order execution and do not arise from DEGIRO.
DEGIRO is required to display the implicit transaction costs in the Annual Costs and Charges Statement. The implicit transaction costs are the difference between the price at which your order was executed and the middle price between the bid and ask prices at the time of execution.
These are not separate costs that have been charged but are included in the purchase price of your shares. DEGIRO has no influence on these costs.

# How do I transfer funds to my DEGIRO account?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/how-do-i-transfer-funds-my-degiro-account

# What is Allocation and how does it work?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/what-allocation-and-how-does-it-work

When you‚Äôre using Margin Loan (Debit Money), your cash balance is negative, and standard interest of 6.90% is being charged.
By allocating an amount, you are basically announcing your intention to use that amount as Margin Loan (Debit Money) in the coming calendar month. This gives us time to prepare and plan accordingly. In return, you get the reduced interest rate of 5.25%.
For a detailed overview of costs and charges, see our¬†Fee Schedule. How to add an allocation Log in to your account, go to the Settings page, and select Allocation. Note that these settings are only visible if you have an Active, Trader, or Intraday account type. Once you‚Äôre¬†on¬†the Allocation page¬†in the trading platform, select Add allocation.¬†The newly added allocation will take effect of on the first day of the following calendar month unless you remove it or edit it before that.¬†You can add an allocation in your account's default currency, but if you have Manual FX enabled, you can add allocations in foreign currencies as well. How to remove or edit an allocation You can see the allocation for the current calendar month under Current allocation. To remove an active allocation, use the pencil icon and set the amount to zero. You can also change the allocation in the same way by setting it to the desired amount. Adjustments will be seen under New allocation. The removal or change of the allocation will take effect on the first day of the following calendar month. Important to know
Allocation is an ongoing service. Once you add or edit an allocation, it will remain in place unless you remove it or edit it again.
An allocation will be applicable for a minimum of a full calendar month. Adding, editing, or removing an allocation will take effect on the first day of the following calendar month.
The interest is always charged on the entire amount allocated, whether it is used or not.
If in one calendar month, you end up using more Margin Loan (Debit Money) than you have allocated for that month, standard interest rate will be charged on the amount exceeding the allocation.
In case you have allocated more than we can currently lend you, you‚Äôll be charged interest on the full amount you have allocated, even when you don‚Äôt currently have that amount of Margin Loan (Debit Money) at your disposal.
It is not possible to allocate more than 9x of your current net liquidity.
As merely a way of announcing your intention to use a certain amount of Margin Loan (Debit Money), allocating will not increase your cash balance nor grant you more margin. The actual margin available to you depends on factors such as value and composition of your portfolio. For details, consult our¬†Investment Portfolio Risk Handbook.
If you want to add an allocation in a foreign currency, Manual FX must be enabled for that currency. Learn more about¬†Currency conversion settings.
The existing Margin Loan (Debit Money) amount you have in a foreign currency cash account will be converted to the account default currency once you activate Auto FX again. However, our allocation in a foreign currency will stay in place, so you might need to adjust it manually.

# Can I trade on margin from DEGIRO?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/trading-margin/can-i-trade-margin-degiro

Yes, it is possible to trade on margin from DEGIRO. This service is referred to as Debit Money.
Trading on margin involves investing more than the cash value held in your Cash Account. When trading on margin from DEGIRO, your Cash Account will be negative. With the Active profile, a more conservative approach to calculating portfolio risk is taken. This means you will have less available margin.
With the Trader profile, a less conservative approach to portfolio risk is taken. The Trader profile allows you to trade with more margin from DEGIRO, however this carries greater risk.
For full information please see the document Debit Money Conditions.

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/trading-margin/i-am-trading-margin-and-now-my-account-deficit-what

Your Available to Trade amount is the sum of your Cash Account, cash held in other currencies, and your available margin. If this value becomes negative, you have exceeded your available margin from DEGIRO. In this case, please either close an open position(s)¬†or make a deposit to your DEGIRO account to cover the deficit.
If the deficit results in a Margin Call from DEGIRO, our Risk department will contact you giving you a deadline to clear the deficit.
Please take into account that market movements can increase/decrease your deficit before the deadline is reached. Additionally, when making a deposit, please keep in mind that it can take up to 3 working days for us to receive and allocate your deposit. If you do not think that your funds will reach your DEGIRO account before your deadline, please send a Proof of Payment to our Risk Department at risk@degiro.nl.
Your Proof of Payment should contain all the following details in one document:
Your full name
Your sort code and account number
DEGIRO's sort code and account number
Transfer date
Transfer amount
Once the Proof of Payment is received by our Risk Department and you have received a confirmation from DEGIRO that your proof has been accepted, your Margin Call will be resolved. However, the Margin Call task will remain visible on the platform until the deposit has been received and the deficit resolved.
Please be aware that sending a Proof of Payment does not guarantee that your proof will be accepted. Our Risk Department can still reject the provided proof if the proof is not sufficient.
Additionally, please ensure you send your Proof of Payment well before the deadline from the email address linked to your DEGIRO account. Received Proof of Payments will be checked and approved by the Risk Department on a best effort basis. Please be aware that if we do not receive this Proof of Payment within a reasonable time before the deadline set for your Margin Call, the Risk Department may not take the proof into account and will start closing some of your positions. DEGIRO will apply charges to close these positions.
More information regarding our margin system and the deficit procedure can be found in Security Value, Risk Debit Money and Debit Securities document and in the Investment Portfolio Risk Handbook. These documents along with the Client Agreement are available at our Helpcentre.

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/trading-margin/why-has-available-trade-not-changed-even-though-i-have

If you want to change the balance of funds you have available to trade without making a deposit, you can try to restructure your portfolio by making transactions. However, if you have made transactions that do not sufficiently impact the risk in your portfolio, the balance under 'Available to trade' will not or barely change.
In the case that one or more transaction(s) has(/have) not lead to the desired change in how much you have available to trade, please revisit our¬†Risk Handbook¬†and the¬†ISI - Security Value, Risk, Debit Money, and Debit Securities¬†for more information on how the risk and 'Available to trade' in your portfolio are calculated.

# How can I trade products listed in foreign currencies?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/how-can-i-trade-products-listed-foreign-currencies-0

To ensure you have a seamless trading experience when investing in products listed in foreign currencies, we automatically convert your money into or back to your base currency.
Automatic currency conversion, or Auto FX, is the widely adopted industry standard used by most of our clients. With Auto FX, the exact amount of your funds is automatically converted whenever your order in a product listed in a foreign currency is executed or if you receive foreign currency income on your account. The timing of the conversion may vary depending on the scenario. For executed orders, the conversion happens at the time of the transaction execution. However, in cases such as receiving dividends in a foreign currency, the conversion typically takes place overnight. Auto FX currency transactions are labeled as 'FX Debit' and 'FX Credit', enabling you to easily monitor them in your account statement.

# What should I do if I have deposited money from the wrong bank account?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/deposits-and-withdrawals/what-should-i-do-if-i-have-deposited-money

In the account statement of your DEGIRO account, you will see that this deposit was declined even though the funds will have been debited from your bank account. We can hold a deposit received for a maximum of 5 business days in case you would like to use this deposit as a verification deposit to link the new bank account. If the deposit cannot be processed within this period, it will automatically be returned to the account from which the deposit originated. Also, please be aware that you can only change your primary bank account three times per year.
If you would like to have the deposit returned before the 5 business days have passed, please¬†contact our Service Desk.

# What does a Cash sweep mean?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/deposits-and-withdrawals/what-does-cash-sweep-mean

Daily cash sweeps are administrative transfers between your personal flatexDEGIRO cash account and your DEGIRO account. At the end of each business day, a calculation is made to determine if more money has been received on your DEGIRO account, or if more money has been spent.
For example, if you have bought shares for a higher amount than sold, an administrative booking (cash sweep) will take place from your personal cash account to your DEGIRO account. If you have sold shares for a higher amount than purchased, the difference will be transferred to your personal cash account by means of an administrative booking (cash sweep) from your DEGIRO account.
The daily cash sweeps are visible in the account statement by turning off the slider at 'Hide cash movements‚Äô.

# Can I withdraw in another currency?

# What is the order duration?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/what-order-duration

When placing an order, you select whether you want the duration to be a Day order or GTC (Good-Till-Cancelled).
A Day order will stay open until it is executed during the trading day, or until the relevant market closes. If the order is not executed by the end of the trading day of the relevant market, the order will be deleted automatically.
A GTC (Good-till-Cancelled) order, on the other hand, will roll over into the next trading day if the order is not executed by the end of the trading day. The way GTC orders are handled will depend on the trading venue. For example, orders placed on Euronext will be valid for one year while orders placed on US exchanges will be valid for 90 days. However, there is no guarantee that the order will not be cancelled for other reasons such as a corporate action of the underlying company, or that the market price has moved too far from the set limit price of your order. For this reason, you should monitor the status of your open orders.

# What are the different order types?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/what-are-different-order-types

# Why has my order has been rejected?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/why-has-my-order-has-been-rejected

There are a number of reasons why an order might not be accepted. DEGIRO offers access to exchanges worldwide, each with varying rules of acceptability for an order to be eligible for execution.
Some common reasons why an order is not accepted can include (but is not limited to):
Price Limit: Many exchanges set a range of acceptability and will reject an order in the case that the order price exceeds this band. This is to prevent excess volatile movements in the price of securities. As such, an order can be rejected in the case that the limit price is too high or too low compared to the last traded price.
Worst-Case Execution Scenario: If your market order has been rejected this may be because the worst-case execution scenario exceeds your available to trade amount. As the price of a market order is not set until the order is executed, we must account for a sudden change in price in the time from the order being placed to the time of execution. If this seems to be the issue then you may wish to either reduce the quantity of the market order or place a limit order, where the maximum execution price will be less than your available to trade.
Incorrect Stop Price: Stop Loss and Stop Limit orders are intended to trigger at a certain point after a fall in stock price. As such, when entering a Stop price, it must be lower than the current trading price of the security.
Tick Size: Some products set a fixed tick size for the minimum movement in the price. An order may be rejected if this price limit is not met. For instance; if a stock requires all prices to be set to a tick size to the nearest ‚Ç¨0.02, an order for ‚Ç¨0.35 would be rejected. In essence, the limit price set must be divisible by the tick size.
Lot Size: Some exchanges require stocks to be purchased in allotments of¬†certain amounts such as 1,000, 10,000, etc. This is particularly common in Asian markets.
DEGIRO suggests familiarising yourself with the rules and conditions of the exchange before you start trading.

# What is the difference between a stop loss order and a stop limit order?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/what-difference-between-stop-loss-order-and-stop-limit-order

Stop Loss orders are designed to limit your loss if a share that you hold falls in price. As soon as the price of a share reaches your Stop price this triggers a Market order to be sent to the place of execution. Dependent on the place of execution, this order type is offered by the exchange or simulated in the IT systems of DEGIRO. In the latter case, this is on a best-effort basis.
Once your Stop Loss is reached, and a market order is triggered, this market order will be executed even if the price of the stock in question subsequently rises above your Stop Loss.
Likewise, when you have a short position, you can place a Stop Loss order to limit your losses if the share price rises. The Stop price becomes the price at which you will start buying back your short position.
In most situations, the last price is used as a trigger, but it can also be that the bid price and ask prices can be used when there is no last price. To avoid bad executions at unfavourable prices, for some product segments the stop loss will not be released when market maker quotes are not in the market or not visible. On the Products& Markets page, you can find what products this may apply to.
A Stop Limit order is a Stop Loss order that, instead of a Market order, generates a Limit order when your chosen 'stop loss' price is reached. In the case of a sell order, your Stop Limit should be below your Stop Loss. In the event that the trading price of the product falls below your Stop Limit, a sell order will not be executed. with this type of order, the buy or sell transaction will not be executed for a worse price than your chosen limit.
Please refer to the Orders and Order Execution Policy¬†document in our Document Centre for more information.
You can learn more about order types in our Investor Academy.

# What is the difference between a limit order and a market order?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/what-difference-between-limit-order-and-market-order

With a Market order, you place an order to execute your transaction at the current best available price. There is no upper bound on this price. With less liquid products, you may receive a worse price than what you anticipated. We therefore strongly advise you to treat this type of order with care.
With a Limit Order you set a minimum price (in case of a sell) or maximum price (in case of a buy) for which you want to execute your order. Your order will never be executed at a worse price than your limit price. If the price that you have stated is not attainable at that time, your order will be sent to the place of execution at which the best-price execution is expected.
Please refer to the Orders and Order Execution Policy¬†document in our Document Centre for more information.
You can learn more about order types in our Investor Academy.

Many stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange trade against GBX (penny sterling). That is a policy of the London Stock Exchange.
At DEGIRO, this currency is automatically converted back to GBP (pound sterling) because the Morgan Stanley money market fund does not offer holdings against the GBX.
In the account statement it also shows that there is paid for the shares in GBX where 1 GBX = 0.01 GBP.

# Why was a transaction executed without my confirmation?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/execution-policy/why-was-transaction-executed-without-my-confirmation

If you see that a transaction has taken place without your knowledge or consent, this is usually due to the processing of a (mandatory) corporate action. Examples of such events are ISIN or name changes or (reverse) stock splits.
Whenever a corporate action takes place, we process it through a simultaneous purchase and sale for the relevant financial instrument. You can recognize such a transaction by the fact that it takes place at the same time (e.g., at 00:00:00) and that the transaction is for the same amount. If you navigate to "Inbox" and then "Account statement", you will see the reason for the transaction in the description.
In short, these transactions are not 'real' transactions, but rather administrative bookings.
If you want to find out more about the specific corporate action, you can usually find the necessary information on the (news page of the) company's investor relations website.

# How can I invest in investment funds?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/orders/placing-order/how-can-i-invest-investment-funds

Investing in investment funds is slightly different from investing in products such as stocks and ETF's. This is because these products are freely traded, whereas shares in an investment fund are traded on a fixed moment set by the issuer of the fund.
How do we process your orders?
When you place an order for a fund that is traded via Euronext Amsterdam we‚Äôll send your order directly to the issuer. Keep in mind that if you place this order after business hours, we‚Äôll send it on the next day the stock exchange is open. Orders for funds that are not listed on the Euronext Amsterdam will be collected once every business day and sent to the issuer. The cutoff time for these orders is 14:55 CET.
When can I expect my order to be executed?
The moment of execution is determined by the issuer of the fund and is generally once every business day. However, it is also possible that a fund trades weekly, monthly, or even quarterly. The orders that have been sent to the issuer will be executed against the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund at the moment of execution.
Because the NAV first has to be calculated, processing fund orders takes a bit longer than buying or selling regular stocks and ETFs. In general this means that if you place an order for a fund on the Euronext Amsterdam before 15.55 CET, the order will be executed the next day the market is open. Orders sent to Global Fund Services generally take 2 ‚Äì 4 business days to be executed if they are submitted before the cut-off time.
Where can I find the exact information on when order execution takes place?
For more information about the specific moments of execution and/or settlement of a specific fund, you can consult the KID ('Key Investor Document')/KIID ('Key Investor Information Document') of the fund, visit the website of the issuer, or contact the issuer directly.
Good to know
Furthermore, we send the orders for funds that trade via Global Fund Services to the issuer via . This could mean that you will not receive the maximum number of shares in the fund as you would have expected with your investment. Unfortunately, DEGIRO cannot influence this.
Lastly, it is important to know that once an order is sent to the issuer, it can no longer be cancelled.
In our knowledge center you'll find more information about¬†investing in funds.

# What are subscription rights and how can I exercise them?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/my-portfolio/what-are-subscription-rights-and-how-can-i-exercise-them

Shareholders may receive subscription rights when a company plans to raise capital through a rights issue. A rights issue allows shareholders to buy new shares of the company at a predetermined subscription price, usually lower than the current market price. Investors who are eligible to receive the rights will receive them in their account before market opening on the ex-date, the cut-off date of stock ownership to be eligible to receive the rights, or the first trading day, if applicable. Companies can issue renounceable rights, which allows investors to trade the subscription rights on the exchange. In this case, investors who do not have shares in the company can trade the subscription rights and/or participate in the rights issue. Companies can also issue non-renounceable rights, in which case investors cannot trade the subscription rights on any exchange.
If you have received rights from a rights issue or bought rights on the exchange,¬†please be aware that if you do not close your position on or before the last trading day or exercise your rights before the deadline, the rights will usually expire worthless.
DEGIRO will inform clients who have received rights from a rights issue via e-mail, including the details of the corporate action and instructions on how to subscribe to the rights. If you received rights and did not receive an e-mail from us, or if you have a related question, you can contact our Corporate Actions team at¬†ca@degiro.com
For more information on corporate actions, such as rights issues, you can consult the relevant company‚Äôs Investor relations page. Please note that a subscription deadline at DEGIRO may differ from the market deadline mentioned in the right issue‚Äôs prospectus.

# What is Smart Order Routing (SOR)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/what-smart-order-routing-sor

To help a client receive the best execution on their order and efficiently access liquidity, financial institutions sometimes make use of what is known as 'smart order routing'. A Smart Order Router (SOR) is an automatic system of order routing that monitors all the trading venues to which it is connected where the product which you would like to trade is available. It will scan all these venues for the best available opposite order to your buy or sell order.
Because of the many different trading venues on which the same product can be traded, the bid and ask prices (and corresponding volumes) of that product tend to vary across venues. The SOR helps to make sure that your order is being screened against the activity on all these venues, so that you might get the best execution on your order.
The Smart Order Router always uses a reference venue to compare all the orders on the alternative venues. A reference venue is the main venue where the product is being traded. This is often a well-known exchange such as Euronext Amsterdam, The London Stock Exchange (main segment), or the New York Stock Exchange.
For more information, visit¬†What is a trading venue?¬†and refer to our Best Execution reports and ISI - Order Execution Policy.¬†On¬†this page, you can find an overview of the markets for which the SOR is available.

# Can my trades be reported to my employer?

# What happens if a position I hold issues a dividend?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/what-happens-if-position-i-hold-issues-dividend

When DEGIRO receives a notification of a dividend it will be shown on your Portfolio tab under the Upcoming Dividends section. After it is paid, the listing will be removed from that section and paid into your cash account. A record of this can then be found in your Account Statement, which can be found in your Inbox tab.
Dividend payments from stock positions will be paid to your account with any applicable withholding taxes deducted. On the ex-date the respective value will be displayed in your account. Typically the funds will be added to your account one working day after the pay date.
It is possible to receive a dividend in stock rather than cash if the company itself offers the possibility as well as the custodian. This option is only available for products listed on European exchanges.

In the app, this is visible after tapping on the number in the centre of the top blue bar.¬†Below, you can find a detailed description of what each number means and how they are connected to each other. Account balance The total value of your account. It represents the balance on your cash account and the total value of all the positions in your portfolio (the value of your investments plus your cash). EUR/GBP/CHF This is the current balance on the cash account. If this value is negative, this means that you are borrowing money from us to finance your investments. The interest for this loan depends on whether or not the loan has been allocated beforehand. Please refer to our¬†Feeschedule¬†for more information on these fees. Portfolio The sum of the value of all your current investments. This also includes foreign currencies and the compensation for the negative interest on your cash account. Day P/L This figure is the total profit or loss on your account for the current trading day, calculated against the last closing price of the products you hold. It resets every day at midnight. Total P/L This figure refers to the total profit or loss since you opened your DEGIRO account. It includes realised and unrealised gains and losses on securities as well as dividends, currency fluctuations and trading fees. Available to trade This represents how much money you still have available to invest with. With a Basic profile, this balance is equal to the balance shown above EUR/GBP/CHF. However, with an Active or Trader profile, this balance includes your available margin or credit. If the value is negative, you are in deficit and could receive a margin call to resolve the deficit. This deficit can be resolved by either depositing more money or by restructuring your portfolio. For more information, please see "I am trading on margin and now my account is in deficit. What should I do?".

# How to place an order for a bond.

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/how-place-order-bond

Placing a buy or sell order for a corporate or government bond is different from placing an order for a stock or ETF. Due to the nature of¬†how bonds work, when investing in bonds you do not specify the amount of bonds you would like to buy or sell and how much you are willing to pay or receive for each - as is the case for stocks and ETFs.
Instead, you specify how much money you would like to have invested in a bond (the nominal value) and how much you are willing to pay for that investment expressed in a percentage of the bond's par value (the limit price). When determining the price for a bond, you are thus essentially answering the question of how much you are willing to over or underpay to receive a specified amount of money. This is because the intrinsic value of a bond is generally a given, since it consists of the par value that will be returned to the bond holder upon maturity plus the coupon payments during the bond's lifetime. Different order types When placing an order for a bond, you have the option of entering four different order types: a limit order, a market order, a stoploss order, and a stoplimit order. The main difference between these order types is whether or not you determine a fixed maximum (or minimum) price that you are willing to pay (or receive) for your order. If you choose a market or stoploss order, you do not specify this price and will only determine how much nominal value you want to invest or receive. For more information, see What is the difference between a limit order and a market order?¬†and What is the difference between a stop loss order and a stop limit order? Good to know Although bond prices are generally a percentage of the par value, our platform will express them in a monetary value. There is no practical difference between these two ways of pricing since 100% of ‚Ç¨100 is ‚Ç¨100.

# What happens if there is a corporate action on a position I hold?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/what-happens-if-there-corporate-action-position-i-hold

If you hold a stock that is taking part in mandatory corporate actions such as a share consolidation, share split, spin-off, takeover, merger, ISIN change, or exchange swap, this will be booked in automatically on your account.
If you hold a stock which is taking part in an optional corporate action such as a Tender Offer or Rights Issuance, once the action is announced you will receive notification from DEGIRO instructing how to take part. If you wish to take part and do not receive a notification from DEGIRO, please contact our service desk by e-mail. What kind of corporate actions are there? Generally, there are two types of corporate actions a company can decide to take. For shareholders, participation in these corporate actions is either voluntary or mandatory.
In case of a voluntary corporate action, those who are eligible to participate can decide whether they would like to participate. This usually means that they have to perform some action, such as signing up for the corporate action. Examples of voluntary corporate actions are a rights issue, an IPO, or a tender offer.
With mandatory corporate actions, those affected by the corporate action do not have a choice in participation. Shareholders of the company that performs the corporate action will automatically participate in the corporate action. Examples of mandatory corporate actions are a (reverse) stock split, a name or ISIN change, or a spin-off. Why have I not received any news about a corporate action? As mandatory corporate actions can be relatively minor, occur quite frequently, and there is no way for you to opt in or out of such a corporate action, we do not inform you of any upcoming mandatory corporate actions. In the case of voluntary corporate actions, we will inform you via e-mail and/or a notification in the Trading Platform.
Please note that it is ultimately the shareholder's responsibility to stay up to date with regard to any corporate developments of the company whose shares they hold. Where can I find information on upcoming corporate actions? Information on all types of corporate actions can usually be found in the¬†Investor Relations¬†or¬†News/Press Release¬†section of the website of the relevant company.
In addition, we always try to inform our clients of any voluntary corporate actions that affect them as soon as we receive the necessary information from our custodian. We will not notify our clients of mandatory corporate actions.

# What is the break even price in my portfolio? What about realised and unrealised profit/loss?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/using-trading-platform/what-break-even-price-my-portfolio-what-about-realised-and

A column showing the break even price (BEP) for each of your open positions can be viewed in the overview of your portfolio. To display these values in the mobile application, you can click on the column "Price" on your portfolio. Then the display will switch from showing the Quantity to the Break Even Price. For each open position, the gross weighted average unit price is shown. This allows you to better see the average price at which your securities were bought (or sold in the case of a short position). Note that Brokerage Fees and Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) are not included in the calculation of the BEP. Example: Buy 10 stocks XYZ at 5‚Ç¨ and then buy 15 stocks XYZ at ‚Ç¨10 : ( (10 x 5) + (15 x 10) ) / 25 = ‚Ç¨8 The value of Unrealised P/L is expressed in the base currency of your account, and includes the impact of the exchange rate on positions held in foreign currencies. This calculation is based on the Break Even Price of your positions. Brokerage Fees, Financial Transaction Tax (FTT), dividends, coupons, interest or financing costs are not included in this calculation.

# How do I search for a product?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/using-trading-platform/how-do-i-search-product

In the top left-hand corner of the Trader, you will find the search box. Here you can search for products to trade. You can search for a stock by name, ticker symbol, or ISIN code. In the App, you find the search by clicking on the "Search" symbol below in the menu bar.
Products can be found using the name, the ISIN and the ticker code, as long as the ticker code contains more than three characters. The ticker code is unique to a product on an exchange. ISIN stands for International Securities Identification Number and identifies tradable securities by their unique code. Different listings of the same product on different exchanges will have the same ISIN.

# Will I receive a certificate to prove I own shares?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/will-i-receive-certificate-prove-i-own-shares

DEGIRO‚Äôs services are provided entirely online. We do not issue any paper (certified) shares or contract notes.

# What is the Break Even Price (BEP)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/my-portfolio/what-break-even-price-bep

The Break Even Price (BEP) refers to the average buy (in case of a long position) or sell (in case of a short position) price for a financial instrument in your portfolio. It is calculated by taking the net cash paid (long) or received (short) for these shares, divided by the amount of shares bought or sold. Transaction fees and taxes are thus not included in the BEP. Example Let's assume you purchase 10 shares of XYZ at ‚Ç¨5 per share for a net total of ‚Ç¨50. Some time later you purchase 15 additional shares of XYZ for ‚Ç¨10 per share for a net total of ‚Ç¨150. The calculation of your cost price is then as follows: ((10 x 5)+(15 x 10))/25 = (50+150)/25 = 200/25 =¬†‚Ç¨8 per share.

# The data shown in the price feed is wrong. Will this affect my orders or positions?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/data-shown-price-feed-wrong-will-affect-my-orders-or-positions

No. Your orders are executed independently of price feed data. An error in price feed data will not affect the actual value of the shares you hold.

# In what currency are dividends paid?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/what-currency-are-dividends-paid

When a company chooses to issue dividends - that is, profits that are being paid out to shareholders - the company decides not only how much the dividends will be, but also in what currency they'll be paid. They can choose to pay the dividends in only one currency (for example, only in Euros) or in more than one currency (for example, in British Pounds and Euros).
Sometimes, you'll see that the dividends you receive from a position are being paid in a different currency from that in which your position is held. At first glance, this might seem¬†inconsistent. However, it is not a hard-and-fast rule that both currencies have to match. This is because the currency of the dividend does not depend on the currency of the share's listing. Ultimately, it is up to the discretion of the company to determine which currency they wish to pay their dividends in.
When you receive dividends in a foreign currency, they will automatically be converted to your base currency unless you have turned on Manual FX for that currency. In this case, the currency will be booked directly to your foreign currency account.
How it works for ETFs¬†and investment funds
Since ETFs and investment funds may receive dividends from companies in different currencies, the issuer of the ETF/investment fund decides how it will handle the dividends. This is called the dividend policy and is disclosed by the¬†issuer¬†of the product. For more information, please refer to the prospectus of each ETF/investment fund¬†and/or other documentation published by the issuer of that¬†product.

# When will I receive the dividend in my account?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/when-will-i-receive-dividend-my-account

Whenever a company pays a dividend, this dividend has to go through various financial institutions like custodians and clearing houses. Once we receive confirmation from our custodian that the payment has been received, we will book the dividends in the accounts that should receive the dividends.
Usually, the dividends are booked within¬†two business days¬†of the payment date of the dividend, however, if the confirmation from our custodian is delayed, it may take a little bit longer. You can always refer to your account overview for the posting of dividends (and any associated taxes). If you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to¬†contact our Service Desk.

# How do I qualify for an upcoming dividend payment?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/my-portfolio/how-do-i-qualify-upcoming-dividend-payment

When a company wants to determine how their upcoming dividends should be distributed, they use two important dates. These are the¬†record date¬†and the¬†ex-dividend¬†date.
On the¬†record date, the company checks who is eligible to receive dividends and how much they should receive. To make sure that those who want to qualify for the upcoming dividend payments are in possession of the shares at the record date, a company generally uses an¬†ex-dividend¬†date. This date is nearly always two business days before the record date. Any transactions that occurred on or after this date may not be settled in time to qualify for the upcoming dividend distribution.
Therefore, if you want to qualify for an upcoming dividend payment, you would need to be in possession of the shares before the ex-dividend date. If you purchase the shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you will not be eligible for the upcoming dividend payment. On the other hand, if you sell the shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you will still be eligible for the upcoming dividend.
Note that dividends are paid to investors who own the shares (i.e., have a long position in the share) and that investors with a short position in the shares are liable to pay the dividends.
The ex- and record dates of a dividend payment can usually be found on the¬†investor relations¬†or¬†press/news release¬†section of the issuer's website. This information is often also published by dedicated financial news sources.

# Can I receive trade confirmations on my orders?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/can-i-receive-trade-confirmations-my-orders

You can choose to receive automatic trade confirmation emails when your orders are executed. To select this option, go to "Notification" in "Settings". There you can activate "Feedback order status" and you will receive a confirmation e-mail every time an order is executed.

# Why is the value of my option position changing after market close?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-platform/my-portfolio/why-value-my-option-position-changing-after-market-close

The reason why you see the price of your option position change after the market closes, is because we have to load a different price for the product at that time of day.
During the trading day, we display the prices of options, as the mid-price between the best¬†bid¬†and the best¬†ask. When the exchange closes, there are no quotes available to determine the mid-price. That is why we display the price of the last trade in the particular option instead. If the mid-price is different from the closing price, this reloading will cause the value of your position to change.
Impact on ‚ÄòAvailable to trade‚Äô value
Since the exchange is closed when we display the last trade of the day, the difference in value does not impact the Available to trade value of the portfolio. Before the market opens on the next trading day, the close price will already be loaded.

# What do the suffixes "ACC" or "DIST" behind an ETF mean?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/what-do-suffixes-acc-or-dist-behind-etf-mean

The suffixes "ACC" and "DIST" behind an ETF's name are shorthand for "Accumulating" and "Distributing". This is an indication of the two different ways of how an ETF can manage the dividends it generates.
For more information on the difference between these two ways of handling dividends, please visit the¬†product page for ETFs in our Knowledge Center.

# What is 'Bid Only'?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/what-bid-only

Sometimes, a structured product, such as a turbo or warrant, does not have an 'ask' price. In such cases, it's in a so-called 'Bid Only' status. This can occur when the product is sold out or when the maximum leverage allowed by local regulators has been exceeded.
Whenever a product is in this 'Bid Only' status, the issuer or liquidity provider (market maker) can no longer offer to sell (more of) these products to the market. The issuer will therefore not show any 'ask' prices and will only show 'bid' prices at which it¬†offers¬†to buy back any products.
For more information about the status and price information of a particular product, please consult the issuer's or exchange's website.

# What is Smart Order Routing (SOR)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/what-smart-order-routing-sor

To help a client receive the best execution on their order and efficiently access liquidity, financial institutions sometimes make use of what is known as 'smart order routing'. A Smart Order Router (SOR) is an automatic system of order routing that monitors all the trading venues to which it is connected where the product which you would like to trade is available. It will scan all these venues for the best available opposite order to your buy or sell order.
Because of the many different trading venues on which the same product can be traded, the bid and ask prices (and corresponding volumes) of that product tend to vary across venues. The SOR helps to make sure that your order is being screened against the activity on all these venues, so that you might get the best execution on your order.
The Smart Order Router always uses a reference venue to compare all the orders on the alternative venues. A reference venue is the main venue where the product is being traded. This is often a well-known exchange such as Euronext Amsterdam, The London Stock Exchange (main segment), or the New York Stock Exchange.
For more information, visit¬†What is a trading venue?¬†and refer to our Best Execution reports and ISI - Order Execution Policy.¬†On¬†this page, you can find an overview of the markets for which the SOR is available.

# What can I do with a delisted product?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/what-can-i-do-delisted-product

What is a delisting?
A delisting is the removal of a listed security from an exchange. Securities such as stocks, ETFs and certain bonds are listed on an exchange where they can be bought and sold. When a security loses its listing, this means that it can no longer be traded on that exchange.
Delisting of a security can be voluntary or mandatory and can, for example, take place when a company:
ceases operations
goes bankrupt
merges
does not meet the exchange's listing requirements
A delisting is usually announced on the investor relations page on the company's website or on the exchange's website.
What can I do with a product that's delisted?
When one of the positions in your account has lost its listing from the exchange (delisted) you have these options: 1 - Find it on another exchange When a security in your portfolio is delisted from one exchange, but is still being traded on another, we can investigate if it is possible to transfer your positions to that exchange. 2 - It is listed on the OTC market If your position is only listed on the OTC (Over-the-counter) market, we can attempt to perform an OTC transaction for you on a best effort basis. 3 - Can't be traded anywhere If the security is no longer being traded on any exchange, this means that it is no longer possible to close any open positions in that security through a normal transaction. The security can only be removed from your portfolio by waiving your economic ownership. 4 - Wait a while You can always keep the position in your portfolio and wait, as it might get re-listed at some point. We can not advise about this or know if this will happen. If you feel that these options do not suffice, and you would like to try to transfer your position to another broker, we will help you do so. Note that a transfer of a delisted product can be a difficult and expensive process. Not all financial institutions accept or facilitate these kinds of transfers.
Just¬†send us an e-mail to¬†clients@degiro.com¬†if you want to take action on any delisted products you have.

# What happens when an order is filled?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/what-happens-when-order-filled

Whenever your buy or sell order has been filled, the transaction has to go through various steps of what's known as the 'custody chain' before it is completed. Below, you'll find a step-by-step description of the process from placing an order to completion of the transaction.
However, you do not have to wait for this process before anything changes in your account. Upon receipt of the transaction confirmation, the positions in your account will be updated and you will be free to place another order in the same product. Placing an order When you decide to buy or sell a financial instrument such as a stock or an options contract, you will have to inform all other potential buyers and sellers of your intentions by sending an order to the market. In this order you specify the financial product you would like to trade, how many shares you would like to trade, how much you are willing to pay or receive for each share, and which order type and duration it should be. Please refer to the¬†Order Types¬†and¬†Placing an Order¬†sections in our Helpdesk for more information.
However, not everyone can enter orders on financial markets. Only those who have a membership at an exchange are allowed to place orders. This is why you need an investment account at a broker such as DEGIRO to trade on financial markets. If you do not have such an account yet, click¬†here¬†to open one for free. Whenever you enter an order in our platform, we send that order to the respective market. This can be done either directly (Direct to Market) or by sending the order to one of our Prime Brokers (Morgan Stanley, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, or ABN Amro Clearing Bank). For more information on how your orders are routed, please visit the¬†Products & Markets¬†page. Filling the order When your order has arrived at the place of execution, it is entered into the order book so that all other market participants can see your order.
If there is another open order that matches the conditions of your order and your order is the first in the order book, the party that issued that order can take the other side of the trade, thereby 'filling' your order.
Note that it is possible that the other party cannot fill your order completely because it does not have the same amount of products available for the same price. This is known as a 'partial fill' or 'partial execution' of your order. In this case, your order can either be filled with more than one transaction, or remain only partially filled because there is no other party that can or wants to fill the remainder of your order. The degree of ease with which your orders can be filled is what is known as the¬†liquidity. Securing the transaction When an order is filled, all relevant parties involved are informed that a trade has been made. On the one hand, the place of execution informs the brokers of both buyer and seller so that they can relay the confirmation to their clients, and on the other hand they inform the parties that secure the transaction. These parties are usually the relevant central counterparty (CCP) - also sometimes called a 'central clearing house' or a combination of these names.
A CCP serves as the intermediary that makes sure that both parties live up to their end of the trade.¬†To do this, they monitor the account balances of their clients (i.e., brokers & other financial institutions)¬†on a daily basis¬†to ensure that they have enough capital to fulfil the trade obligation. In effect,¬†they step in to take the position of both the seller and the buyer, thereby becoming the new counterparty for both parties of the trade. They record the details of the trade in their administration and create open positions for (the custodians of) both parties. The open positions serve as a recorded obligation for both parties of the trade: one party has to deliver the cash and the other must deliver the financial instrument(s). Settling the transaction n the final stage of the trade,¬†the Central Securities Depository (CSD) will record the change of ownership of the financial instrument in their administration and send the confirmations back through the custody chain. These days, this is usually via a book entry, since shares are often no longer physical certificates.
For more information on how a transaction of a financial instrument is settled, please refer to article 13.7 of the¬†Client Agreement.

# Why do I have to complete a test before I can trade a product?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/why-do-i-have-complete-test-i-can-trade-product

As a regulated financial institution, DEGIRO is required to conduct an Appropriateness Test for complex financial instruments. The test aims to assess your knowledge and/or experience with regards to investing in Financial Instruments and the different types of Financial Instruments that you can trade via our platform.¬†Investing in Financial Instruments without sufficient knowledge and/or experience leads to an increased risk of loss.
Without passing the respective test, it is not possible to open a new position in the respective products or to increase an existing position. However, it is still possible to close existing positions in these product groups. If you do not pass the test, you can try two more times. If you have not passed the test after the third attempt, you can retake the test again after 24 hours.
Once an Appropriateness Test has been passed, the respective product group can be enabled via the 'Product Settings' section of our platform's settings.
For more information on the different characteristics of various financial products, please visit our¬†Knowledge Center¬†and/or refer to¬†ISI - Characteristics and risks of Financial Instruments.
Please note that this is different from the test you are required to do to enable Basic and Standard investment products. The outcome of this general test does not affect the availability of the financial instruments on your platform.

# What is the difference between American and European style options?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/what-difference-between-american-and-european-style

If you would like to trade in options, it is important to know the difference between the two styles of options: American and European.
The main difference between these two, is the ability to exercise the option before the expiration date. Where American options can be exercised at any time, European options can only be exercised on the expiration date.
For a detailed explanation of options, including more information on the differences between these two styles, please see¬†'What are options?'.

# What products are available to trade through DEGIRO?

# Can I trade on the London Stock Exchange AIM Segment?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/can-i-trade-london-stock-exchange-aim-segment

Through DEGIRO you can trade in LSE AIM stocks, however there are a few points to consider before starting to trade AIM stocks.
The Alternative Investment Market, or AIM, was launched with the purpose of allowing smaller companies to gain a listing on a stock exchange without the entry and regulatory requirements of the main LSE. The FTSE AIM works differently than the main market.
The London Stock Exchange offers three trading services for equity securities.
The SETS is the primary order book for large cap LSE stocks and some of the more liquid AIM stocks. It features a full electronic order book with executable quotes and centralised clearing.
The SETSqx trading service is more commonly used for less liquid or smaller companies. SETqx listed products do not offer continuous trading as SETS products but rather trade via four intra-day electronic order book auctions scheduled at 9am, 11am, 2pm, and 4:35pm. Stocks can also trade OTC (over-the-counter) by individual market makers outside of these auction times. Please note
You cannot participate in the SETSqx auctions via our platform; your orders will always be sent to the market makers instead of the exchange since liquidity is generally very low during these auctions. The price information shown in your Trading Platform does, however, reflect the prices from the auction. You will thus see the prices from the auction, but you will not trade directly against these prices. The prices in your Trading Platform thus serve as an indicator of the current market value of the product, but are no guarantee that you will receive execution against these prices. The SEAQ (Stock Exchange Automated Quotation system) is a non-electronic executable quote service where market makers provide AIM stock quotes. The system has no publicly available order book and trades conducted in a quote driven market traded OTC.
DEGIRO recommends that potential investors inform themselves of the specifics of each trading service before trading on the AIM exchange, as liquidity can be limited, information may not be publicly available, and trades may be conducted off book and outside of auction times, despite other open orders in the market at the time. You can find on which trading service each security trades on the London Stock Exchange website.
For more information, DEGIRO recommends reading the LSE's document on trading services.
The information presented above is intended to provide basic information in relation to the FTSE AIM market and should not be considered to be trading advice. DEGIRO accept no responsibility in any inaccuracies or incorrect information. All trading carries risks and investors should remain knowledgeable about the products and markets they are trading in. Further information can be obtained by referring to the London Stock Exchange website.

# How can I roll options / futures?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/derivatives/how-can-i-roll-options-futures

If you would like to extend your position in an option that is about to expire, you can 'roll' your position. You can do this by¬†placing a combination order¬†to close the old position and open a new position with your desired maturity date.
Note¬†we can only process combination orders if the options are traded on Euronext.

# How long does a portfolio transfer take?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/how-long-does-portfolio-transfer-take

Due to the many variables involved, we cannot say exactly how long your portfolio transfer will take. It depends on many things, such as the direction of the transfer, the complexity of the portfolio and delivery routes, the availability of the products on both trading platforms as well as the time the parties involved need to process the transfer completely.
This means, that a portfolio transfer could be completed in a matter of days, but we have also seen it taking more than a month. We strive to complete your portfolio transfer in three weeks, but we cannot guarantee this.

# How do I enable short selling?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/how-do-i-enable-short-selling

To short sell on your DEGIRO account, you will first need to upgrade your Basic account to an Active or Trader account. You will need to pass two appropriateness tests and sign additional conditions. You can upgrade your account free of charge.

# What is a tender offer?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/what-tender-offer

In a tender offer (public takeover bid) a party makes a public offer to the shareholders to sell their shares at a fixed price. A tender offer can be classified as a voluntary corporate action as shareholders can choose whether or not to accept the offer. An ‚Äôexchange offer‚Äô is a special tender offer where shares or other non-cash alternatives are offered instead of cash.
If the majority of the shares are tendered - i.e., the majority of the shares have been offered for sale under the tender offer's conditions - during the first tender period, a second and often last tender period is initiated. If a majority of these outstanding shares are tendered at the end of the second tender period, the acquiring company may decide to delist the shares from the stock exchange. In case investors do not tender or sell their shares in the market, they might risk ending up with a delisted and non-tradeable position. If this is the case we are not able to sell your shares as they are no longer publicly traded on the stock exchange.
What is a squeeze out?
In some cases, the acquiring company may initiate a so-called¬†squeeze out, in which any non-tendered shares may still be acquired via a compulsory takeover by the acquiring company. There is no guarantee¬†a squeeze out will always occur. It generally takes over one year after the delisting date for any squeeze out to be initiated. All relevant information on a company's corporate actions can be found on the company's Investor Relations page.

# What is a corporate action?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/what-corporate-action

A corporate action is a change in a company that affects its shareholders. Corporate actions can range from urgent financial matters, such as bankruptcy, to a company changing its name.
Corporate actions include:
Stock splits
Dividend payments
Mergers and acquisitions
Rights issues
Spin-offs
Tender offers
Scrip dividend
In most cases, shareholders can vote on the corporate action in advance at a shareholder meeting. In other cases, the corporate action is approved by the board of directors of the company.
Corporate actions can be either mandatory or voluntary.Mandatory corporate actions¬†are processed automatically, while¬†voluntary corporate actions¬†give investors a choice to participate. In some cases, there can be a mandatory corporate action with a choice (mandatory with choice). Examples of mandatory corporate actions include stock splits, mergers, and companies changing their name. Examples of voluntary corporate actions include tender offers, scrip dividend and rights issues.
Corporate actions can have a major impact on the financial instrument concerned and are therefore announced on the Investor Relations page of the company. If you want to be informed of Corporate actions, be sure to take a look at this company page.

# When will a terminated structured product be removed from my account?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/when-will-terminated-structured-product-be-removed-my

Once a structured product has been terminated, the issuer will take the product off the market and determine if there is any residual value left in the product. If so, this residual value will generally be paid around 5 business days after the termination of the product. Once we have received payment of the residual value, the product will be removed from your portfolio, and the cash will be booked into your account.

# What is a rights issue?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/what-rights-issue

In a rights issue, a company issues subscription rights (sometimes also referred to as 'claims') to its existing shareholders to raise additional money. These subscription rights can be used to buy additional shares in the company at a predetermined price that is usually below the current market price. Existing shareholders receive rights in their portfolio on a pro rata basis, meaning that the number of rights they receive depends on the number of shares they own before a specified date. This date is known as the 'ex-date'.
The receivers of these rights are not obliged to exercise them. However, they must make their choice before the rights expire. Generally, the receiver of rights has three options:
Use the rights to buy new shares (also known as 'subscribing' to the new shares or 'exercising' the rights)
Trading the rights in the market (only if the rights are listed on an exchange)
Take no action. The rights will eventually be booked out as worthless.
All the necessary and relevant information about a rights issue can be found on the company's Investor Relations page or a major financial news source.
How are rights processed in my account?
If you own enough shares to qualify for the subscription rights before the ex-date, you will automatically receive these rights in your portfolio. To help you along, we will send you an e-mail about these rights and what you can do with them.
If you have successfully exercised your rights, we will remove them from your portfolio after the deadline has passed and replace them with a non-tradeable position that acts as a placeholder. Once we receive the new shares, we remove the non-tradeable position and add the new shares to your portfolio.

# What is a (reverse) stock split?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/what-reverse-stock-split

When a company issues a (reverse) stock split (share split), they increase (or decrease) the amount of shares outstanding. They do this without issuing new shares and without increasing (or decreasing) the total share capital. A stock split has a ratio, which represents how many new shares will exist for every old share.
For example, in a stock split with a 2:1 ratio, the shareholder receives two shares for each share they hold in their possession.
Why do companies issue stock splits?
One possible goal of a stock split is to increase the liquidity of the share. Companies issue stock splits to reduce (or increase) the nominal value of one share. The total share capital will be divided over more (or less) shares, which would cause the value of one share to decrease (or increase). A lower (or higher) share price can improve the accessibility or desirability of investing in that company, which would mean that more people are able to trade their shares, which increases liquidity.
What is a reverse stock split?
This is the opposite from an 'ordinary' stock split: instead of splitting one share into several pieces, multiple shares get combined into one. This results in an increase in the share price instead of a decline, whilst the total share capital does not change.
Do I need to do anything?
A (reverse) stock split is a mandatory corporate action. This means that shareholders of the company whose shares are being split are not presented with a choice to participate in the corporate action. Thus, no action by the shareholders is required.
Examples
Stock splits are a very common occurrence. For instance, we have seen a stock split for Tesla (3-for-1) in August 2022. Apple also has performed various stock splits throughout their history, and our own stock has also been split in a 4-for-1 ratio back in August 2021.
However, not all companies perform stock splits when their share reaches a certain price. Berkshire Hathaway's A-shares have famously never split, even though the share price is the most expensive share in the world, having traded as high as $450.000 per share.
Note that these examples serve only informative purposes. This may not be considered investment advice.

# What is a corporate spin-off?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/what-corporate-spin

If a corporate ‚Äòspin-off‚Äô happens, it means that a parent company turns one of their divisions into an independent company. They do this by selling or distributing new shares (divestement).
What happens in a spin-off?
In the case of a spin-off, part of the original shares are converted into shares of the new, spun-off company. As a shareholder you don‚Äôt have to do anything if a spin-off happens.
Examples of spin-off's
Big companies often turn departments into independent companies. For example, Signify and ASML used to be part of Philips, and Pay-Pal spun-off from e-Bay in 2015. The shareholders automatically got a few shares (based on the number of shares they held with the parent company) of these new companies in their portfolio.

# Can I participate in an IPO via DEGIRO?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/trading-possibilities/products-and-markets/can-i-participate-ipo-degiro

An¬†Initial Public Offering¬†(IPO) allows a company to raise capital from public investors by¬†offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance. Because we offer our services exclusively to retail investors, the possibilities for participating in an IPO via DEGIRO depend on the conditions of the IPO set by the company.¬†The company offering these shares determines whether this offering is available to retail or professional investors, or both. In the case that an IPO is accessible to our clients, we aim to inform you about this as soon as possible.
Furthermore, we are a European broker. As such, we cannot facilitate a participation in an IPO of an American company.

# How can I reclaim withholding taxes on income out of Switzerland?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/how-can-i-reclaim-withholding-taxes-income-out-switzerland

If you want to reclaim withholding taxes on income out of Switzerland (Verrechnungssteuer) ‚Äì such as taxes on dividends or interest payments, you will need to file a request for refund with the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (SFTA). For such a request, you could be asked to provide proof that the taxes have been paid. To provide proof, you might need a Swiss Tax Voucher and/or a dividend note. Important notice: We cannot provide advice about or assist with the tax reclaims since we are an Execution-Only broker. Our clients bear full and sole responsibility for managing their own application. If you need help with this, please consult your own tax advisor. Any refund will be the decision of the SFTA and the Swiss authorities.
What is a Swiss Tax Voucher?
A Swiss Tax Voucher is a document that confirms that a non-Swiss bank has paid what‚Äôs known as the ‚ÄúVerrechnungssteuer‚Äù to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (SFTA). Verrechnungssteuer is the Swiss federal withholding tax (WHT) on dividend and interest income sourced in Switzerland. This must be withheld at source and is directly deducted from the gross amount paid to the recipient.
Please be aware that tax vouchers alone do not grant the right to reimbursement. Whether reimbursement will take place is a decision made by the SFTA.
How the ‚ÄúVerrechnungssteuer‚Äù is paid?
The ‚ÄúVerrechnungssteuer‚Äù must be withheld at source and is directly deducted from the gross amount paid to the recipient. A 35% of WHT is levied on dividend and interest income derived from Swiss sources.
Can you assist in reclaiming the "Verrechnungssteuer"?
We are an Execution Only broker, so we can't help or advise you with the filing or administration of the application. The application must be accurately completed by the beneficial owner (i.e., the recipient of the income) as prescribed by the SFTA. However, we do aim to help by providing you on a best-effort basis with any information you might need for your application, such as the Tax Voucher and/or dividend note for the relevant dividend event. We follow the instructions of the SFTA for non-Swiss financial institutions in the preparation of these documents, but we cannot guarantee that the SFTA will always accept and process the documents.
How can I file a claim for a WHT refund?
To find out how filing a claim for a WHT refund works, please consult the website of the SFTA. There, you‚Äôll find the¬†rules for the refund procedures, the necessary forms to fill out for both¬†Swiss tax residents¬†and¬†non-Swiss tax residents, and more.

# What is the Italian Financial Transaction Tax (Italian FTT)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/what-italian-financial-transaction-tax-italian-ftt

Italian FTT is applied to transactions on Italian equity instruments (491-taxation) and on transactions in derivative instruments (492-taxation).
DEGIRO automatically calculates, withholds, reports, and pays on behalf of clients the Italian FTT due.
491-taxation applies to shares and other equity instruments issued by Italian tax resident companies with a market cap of at least ‚Ç¨500 million (as of November the preceding year) and other financial instruments that represent those shares. A list of Italian resident companies currently not in the scope of Italian FTT (as of 2020) can be found here and here.
492-taxation applies to derivative products whose value for more than 50% depends on financial instruments subject to 491-taxation, irrespective of the issuer‚Äôs residence.
The taxable event for 491-taxation is the purchase transaction and the acquisition resulting from the exercise or assignment of derivatives positions. A redemption of shares or other corporate actions may be exempted from 491-taxation.
The taxable event for 492-taxation is the purchase and the sell transaction of a derivative contract.
The applicable tax rate for a 491-taxation is 0.10% (as of 2020) for transactions dealt on a regulated market or a multilateral trading facility. For trades outside these markets, the applicable rate is 0.20% (as of 2020). This rate is charged on the transaction value, whereby intraday buy and sell trades per financial instrument are netted. At DEGIRO we process the intraday netting at day end. This means that during the day all acquisitions are taxed in full and any potential refund will be credited after market close.
The tax rate for 492-transactions varies and depends on the type of derivative, the total (notional) value of the contract and whether the derivative was traded on a regulated exchange or not.

# Why does DEGIRO ask about my tax residency?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-residency/why-does-degiro-ask-about-my-tax-residency

DEGIRO is a financial institution and as such is legally obliged to inform the Dutch tax authorities of the countries in which you are considered a tax resident. The Dutch government cooperates with many other countries to counter tax evasion and therefore requests this information from financial institutions. This is further explained below in the questions ‚ÄòWhat are Common Reporting Standards (CRS)?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)?‚Äô. Moreover, we may ask your tax residency to determine whether a reduced withholding tax rate applies under a tax treaty established between your residence country and the source country (for example, the tax treaty with the US).

# How does DEGIRO report my gross proceeds?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/how-does-degiro-report-my-gross-proceeds

Following the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), DEGIRO, as a bank operating under Dutch Law, is obliged to share your financial account information with the Dutch Tax Authority. This is what we are required to share:
Name and address
Tax residence country and tax identification number
Date of birth and place of birth
Username
Account balance at year end
Gross amount of interest, dividend and other income
Gross sale proceeds (this does not include income or your return on investments or gains. It means ‚Äòthe total gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of Financial Assets paid or credited to the account‚Äô.
The Dutch Tax Authority shares this information with the Tax Authority of the country where you (the client) are a tax resident. The Tax Authority bases your residency on the information that you have given us. Tax authorities might question taxpayers on the information provided to the authority through this CRS obligation. Gross proceeds can be evaluated as capital gains, dividend income, or return on investment earned by investors. If you have questions about the way the Tax Authority processes your information, it is best to talk to your own tax or financial advisor to clarify matters. We cannot intervene and cannot help you as we are just following mandatory standards.
How can I find this (CRS) information myself?
If you log into your account and go to profile, you can see all the personal information you have provided to us. Such as name, address, tax residency and similar information that is reported under CRS.
Information about all income, dividends and gross proceeds¬†(sales performed)¬†from the investments and transactions you made, can also be found in your account (only the web based version, not in the app). Go to 'Inbox' and click 'Account Statement', the above mentioned information is gathered there. The overviews can also be exported as a separate file. For more information on this, see our¬†FAQ. What is the CRS exactly?
In order to prevent tax evasion and protect the integrity of tax systems, The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has set up a system to make it easier for countries to share information about financial accounts. This is called the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and is an international reporting obligation. CRS is incorporated in Dutch law, and therefore we as DEGIRO has to oblige.
Good to know
As an execution only broker DEGIRO does not provide tax consultation or advisory services. Please consult with your tax or financial advisor to clarify the matter in dispute with local tax authority.

# What is withholding tax and when is it charged?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/what-withholding-tax-and-when-it-charged

When you invest in financial instruments, you might encounter taxation on your income, such as on dividends or coupons. Directly at the pay-out of the income, tax is withheld and paid to the tax authorities of the resident country of the paying organisation (source country). This form of taxation is called withholding tax. Examples are dividend withholding tax and interest withholding tax. Withholding tax is usually withheld by the paying agent of the paying organisation, but withholding can also take place higher up the custody chain. DEGIRO usually receives the income as a net amount, after the deduction of the withholding tax. Withholding tax rates differ depending on the source country and the nature of the income paid.

# Which statutory withholding tax rate applies to the dividend income in my account?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/which-statutory-withholding-tax-rate-applies-dividend-income-my-account

The (statutory) dividend withholding tax rate that applies to dividends received on your investments depends on the rules of the source country and the nature of the product. Below you can find a general overview of the statutory rates that apply to the dividend income per source country. Note that dividend distributions are subject to rules and regulations and that the applied tax rate can differ from the rate in this table based on the event date of the dividend payment.

# What is a Tax Identification Number (TIN)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-residency/what-tax-identification-number-tin

A Tax Identification Number (TIN) is internationally used as an identification number for tax purposes. The issuance, structure, use and validity of the TIN differs per country. In general, TINs are automatically issued upon birth or upon becoming subject to tax in a country. In Ireland, your TIN is your Personal Public Service (PPS) Number.

# How is it possible that a German withholding tax is levied on a dividend payment of an ETF, while the ETF is located in Luxembourg and is listed on an Irish Stock Exchange?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/how-it-possible-german-withholding-tax-levied-dividend-payment-etf-while-etf

The tax treatment differs per Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) and is among others dependent on the fund structure. The following aspects need to be considered: A fund can be considered fiscally transparent or non-transparent. Income received through a fiscally transparent fund is considered to be directly attributable to the participant of the fund (for tax purposes you have to look through the fund). In case of a non-transparent fund, the income flows to the fund itself.
Whether a fund can be considered fiscally transparent is dependent on the local legislation in the country where the fund is established. This may differ per country.
To answer the question asked; German withholding tax can be levied in the case that the ETF is considered a fiscal transparent fund based on Luxembourg legislation and the income the fund receives originates from a German investment. The income and the accompanying German withholding tax are then attributed to the fund participant who is considered to have received the income directly.

# What are Common Reporting Standards (CRS)

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-residency/what-are-common-reporting-standards-crs

To help fight tax evasion and to protect the integrity of tax systems, governments around the world introduced a system for automatic exchange of information on financial accounts between countries. This system is known as CRS and is incorporated in Dutch law. As a result, DEGIRO is obliged to verify in which country a client is (potentially) a tax resident. DEGIRO is obliged to share this information with the Dutch tax authorities. Subsequently, the Dutch tax authorities share this information with the tax authorities in the country where the relevant client (potentially) is a tax resident.

# Can I be a tax resident in a country if I don't pay any taxes in that country?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-residency/can-i-be-tax-resident-country-if-i-dont-pay-any-taxes-country

Yes, that is possible. The concept of tax residency entails that the country which considers you a tax resident designates you as subject to its domestic tax laws. Domestic tax law and/or tax treaties concluded by this country can subsequently exempt the subject (you) or the object (your income) from taxation. As a result, you effectively do not pay tax in that country while you are still considered to be a tax resident in that country.

# What is the UK Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (UK stamp duty)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/what-uk-stamp-duty-reserve-tax-uk-stamp-duty

The acquirer of the equity instrument is subject to UK stamp duty. The UK stamp duty is automatically withheld and DEGIRO passes this tax charge on to its clients. In general, UK stamp duty applies to shares issued by a company established in the UK or with a share register in the UK. Eligible securities listed on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) segment are excluded from Stamp Duty. The taxable event is the purchase transaction. The tax rate is 0.50% (as of 2020) and is calculated on the transaction value.

# What is the Belgian Financial Transaction Tax (Belgian FTT)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/what-belgian-financial-transaction-tax-belgian-ftt

In general, the Belgian financial intermediary is liable to pay Belgian FTT. In case transactions are executed by a foreign financial intermediary, the taxpayer status is generally shifted to the Belgian resident individual or corporate entity. The Belgian resident is however relieved of his obligation to pay the tax if the foreign financial intermediary pays on his/her behalf. DEGIRO collects Belgian FTT from its Belgian resident clients. DEGIRO then pays and reports the Belgian FTT to the Belgian tax authorities. Belgian resident clients can however choose to calculate and pay the tax and furnish the preparation and filing of a Belgian FTT tax return themselves. Belgian FTT applies to financial instruments issued by Belgian and non-Belgian resident companies. The financial instruments in scope include, but are not limited to, shares, ETFs, bonds, contractual fund participations, shares in investment companies, and certificates. Transactions in CFDs and futures are not included in the scope. The taxable event includes both the buy as well as the sell transaction when it takes place in exchange for a consideration (payment) and is executed on the secondary market (for example, an exchange). For example, the purchase or sale of a share on the exchange is subject to Belgian FTT. Conversely, the purchase of a call option is not subject to Belgian FTT, however the acquisition of the underlying stock upon exercise or assignment of the option is subject to Belgian FTT. Additionally, the redemption of a share in an accumulating investment company is also considered a taxable event.

# What is the Greek Financial Transaction Tax (Greek FTT)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/what-greek-financial-transaction-tax-greek-ftt

The person alienating a financial instrument is subject to Greek FTT. Greek FTT is automatically withheld and DEGIRO passes this tax on to clients.
Greek FTT applies to transactions in shares listed on a regulated market or a multilateral trading facility operating in Greece.
The taxable event is the sell transaction. The tax rate for Greek FTT is 0.10% (as of¬†January 2024)¬†and is calculated on the transaction value.

# How do I know that I am a US person?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-residency/how-do-i-know-i-am-us-person

As a private individual, you are a US Person if you are considered a US citizen/national or a US residential alien. The term ‚ÄúUS citizen/national" comprises:
Any individual born in the United States (including Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands)
Any individual whose parent(s) is a US citizen (additional conditions apply)
Any individual who has been naturalized as a US citizen.
The term "US resident aliens" comprises:
Any individual that possesses or has possessed a US green card.
Any individual that meets the substantial presence test for the calendar year.
Please visit the IRS website, for more information about the green card and the substantial presence test.

# Why has the withholding tax rate been updated that I received earlier?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/why-has-withholding-tax-rate-been-updated-i-received-earlier

This is probably due to the reclassification of income distributions. In certain situations, claims and elections made by the issuer during or after the fiscal year can affect the nature of the income with retroactive effect. As a result, the tax treatment of some or all of the income that was distributed to investors during the year may change. Income distributions from certain financial instruments are most likely to experience income reclassification, such as US Real Estate Investment Trusts (US REITs) and US mutual funds. In addition, investments in certain assets, such as commodities and real estate are also more likely to require income reclassification.

# What is the French Financial Transaction Tax (French FTT)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/what-french-financial-transaction-tax-french-ftt

The acquirer of a financial instrument is subject to French FTT. However, DEGIRO automatically calculates, withholds, reports and pays the French FTT due.
French FTT applies to certain shares, or similar instruments, issued by French tax resident companies with a market cap of at least ‚Ç¨1 billion (as of 1 December of the preceding year) as well as certain instruments representing these shares. In addition, the instrument must be admitted for trading on a French, European or foreign regulated market. For the list of companies in the scope of French FTT (as of 2019), you can click here.
The taxable event is the purchase transaction as well as the acquisition as a result of the exercising or assignment of a derivative position. This means that the purchase of a call option is not subject to FTT, whereas the acquisition of the underlying stock upon exercise of an option is subject to FTT.
The tax rate for French FTT is 0.30% (as of 2020) and is calculated on the transaction value. Intraday transactions per financial instrument are netted.
At DEGIRO we process the intraday netting at the end of the day. This means that during the day, all acquisitions are taxed in full and any potential refund will be credited after market close.

# How do I determine the tax residency of the issuer (source country)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/how-do-i-determine-tax-residency-issuer-source-country

It can be difficult to determine the tax residency of an organisation based on information that is publicly available. Rules for determining tax residency vary from country to country. It is, therefore, possible that an organisation is considered a tax resident in multiple countries. If this is the case, a tax treaty determines which country has which levying rights. Furthermore, the tax residency determination is usually dependent on specific facts and circumstances. The Netherlands, for example, takes into consideration whether the company is incorporated under Dutch law, where important business decisions are made, where lies the decision-making authority, where statutory directors meet and work, and where the books are kept, amongst other things.

# Why is the lower tax treaty rate not automatically applied?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-treaties/why-lower-tax-treaty-rate-not-automatically-applied

In practice, applying the lower tax treaty rate to your foreign income at the source is usually not possible. This is due to the fact that, for the withholding agent, it is not clear who the ultimate beneficiary of the income is. This is caused by the fact that there can be many parties interposed between the beneficial owner and withholding agent, such as (several) foreign and domestic parties in the custody chain (custodians). The withholding agent then withholds the statutory tax rate and not the lower tax treaty rate.

# How can I reclaim the difference between the statutory withholding tax rate and the tax treaty rate?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-treaties/how-can-i-reclaim-difference-between-statutory-withholding-tax-rate-and-tax-treaty

In cases where a lower tax rate should be applied on the basis of a tax treaty, it is occasionally possible to reclaim part of the withheld tax in the source country. To reclaim excess paid withholding tax, a reclaim request needs to be submitted to the tax authorities in the source country. The complexity of the reclaim process varies per country.
Each country adopted its own reclaim procedure. Usually, these procedures are time-consuming, costly and require the cooperation of different parties. For this reason, it is seldom profitable to start a reclaim procedure.

# How do I know which tax treaty applies?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-treaties/how-do-i-know-which-tax-treaty-applies

You need to determine in which country you are considered a tax resident and in which country the issuer is a tax resident. For instance, if an Irish tax resident receives a dividend payment on his/her shares of Volkswagen AG (Germany), the Irish-German tax treaty needs to be consulted. It is not relevant that DEGIRO is a tax resident in the Netherlands for the application of the tax treaty, as DEGIRO is not the ‚Äòbeneficial owner‚Äô of the income.

# What is a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation (tax treaty)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-treaties/what-treaty-avoidance-double-taxation-tax-treaty

A tax treaty is an agreement between two countries stipulating which country has which levying rights in respect of a particular income. This prevents a person from being taxed twice (by two countries) on the same income. The content of a tax treaty differs per bilateral situation and thus the precise tax consequences can only be determined by consulting the relevant bilateral tax treaty. Most tax treaties provide for a mitigated withholding tax on dividend and interest income.

# How is it possible that for US income the lower tax treaty is applied?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-treaties/how-it-possible-us-income-lower-tax-treaty-applied

The United States has introduced a system where, under certain conditions, the lower tax treaty rate can directly be applied at source. DEGIRO has entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (US tax authority) to make use of this system. This way DEGIRO enables its clients to benefit from the lower tax treaty rates provided for in the tax treaty between their country of tax residence and the United States. In general, the U.S. tax treatie provide for a reduced withholding tax rate of 15% on dividend income.

# What is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-residency/what-foreign-account-tax-compliance-act-fatca

FATCA is somewhat similar to CRS, but then specifically to fight against tax evasion in the United States. FATCA ensures that ‚ÄòU.S. Persons‚Äô file a (complete) tax return with the US Internal Revenue Service that also contains their assets maintained at financial institutions outside the United States. FATCA is incorporated in Dutch law and as a result, DEGIRO is obliged to verify whether its clients are considered U.S. Person. DEGIRO is obliged to share this information with the Dutch tax authorities. Subsequently, the Dutch tax authorities shares this information with the US Internal Revenue Service.

# What is the Irish Stamp Duty (IE stamp duty)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/what-irish-stamp-duty-ie-stamp-duty

The acquirer of the equity instrument is subject to Irish stamp duty. Irish stamp duty is automatically withheld and DEGIRO passes this tax charge on to its clients. IE Stamp Duty generally applies to shares or similar instruments issued by Irish companies listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. Small and medium sized companies listed on Euronext Growth (formerly the Enterprise Securities Market) of the Irish Stock Exchange are exempted from IE Stamp Duty. The taxable event is the purchase transaction. The tax rate is 1.00% (as of 2020) of the transaction value.

# What is the Hong Kong stamp duty (HK stamp duty)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/what-hong-kong-stamp-duty-hk-stamp-duty

Both the person acquiring and the person alienating the financial instrument are subject to HK stamp duty. The HK stamp duty is automatically withheld and DEGIRO passes this tax charge on to its clients.
In general, HK Stamp Duty is applied to transactions in shares that are listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
The taxable event is the purchase as well as the sell transaction.
The tax rate is 0.26% per transaction (as of August 2021) and is shared equally between the buyer (0.13%) and the seller (0.13%). The tax rate is calculated over the transaction value.

# Does DEGIRO work on a solution for obtaining the reduced tax treaty rate?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-treaties/does-degiro-work-solution-obtaining-reduced-tax-treaty-rate

Excess withheld tax is a known issue in the financial sector. Supranational organisations, such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Union (EU) have been working on (potential) solutions for quite some time. DEGIRO monitors the developments in this area and is constantly exploring solutions that make investing cheaper and more attractive for its customers.

# What is financial transaction tax?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/what-financial-transaction-tax

Financial transaction tax is the collective term for taxes levied on transactions in financial instruments. Countries such as Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom have introduced a transaction tax. In Ireland, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, the transaction tax takes the form of a "stamp duty". These countries all use different parameters to determine whether a transaction is taxed and at what rate. This can even result in multiple transaction taxes applying to a single transaction.

# I have received income from the United States where a tax rate of 37 % is applied; how is this possible?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-treaties/i-have-received-income-united-states-where-tax-rate-37-applied-how-possible

Your investment is probably a US partnership. These fiscally transparent partnerships do not pay tax on their business profits in the United States, but instead, the participants who invest in the partnership are included in US taxation. For participants from outside the United States, tax is levied by applying withholding tax on the income distributions of the partnership. The rate of this withholding tax is usually 37% and the US taxation right on this income is not restricted by a tax treaty.

# What happens if I have a short position in a financial instrument on ex-date?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/what-happens-if-i-have-short-position-financial-instrument-ex-date

If you hold a short position on the ex-date of the income, you have the obligation to reimburse the lender of the financial instrument for an amount equal to the gross income that would have been distributed to him would he not have lent you the financial instrument. This contractual compensation is generally referred to as a substitute payment.

# How can I apply for the lower tax rate for US income?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-treaties/how-can-i-apply-lower-tax-rate-us-income

Many countries have a bilateral tax treaty with the United States that allowes investors to apply for a lower tax rate on dividend and interest income. You can therfore ask us to apply this¬†lower tax treaty rate¬†for your DEGIRO account. You can do this by completing the form ‚ÄòW-8BEN/ W-8BENE‚Äô, which you can find under ‚ÄòTax information‚Äô in your account settings.

# Does DEGIRO issue tax vouchers?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-treaties/does-degiro-issue-tax-vouchers

Sometimes tax authorities require a tax document such as a tax voucher, dividend note or another tax statement from your broker in order to process tax reclaims or to credit withholding tax in your personal income tax return. Currently, DEGIRO is unable to issue such tax documents. Such documents are subject to strict rules. As DEGIRO is liable for the content of the tax documents, it needs to be sure that the documents are compliant and auditable in line with different relevant regulations.
In addition, DEGIRO is dependent on information from other parties within the custody chain. DEGIRO is working on a solution so that it will be able to issue tax documents in the future.

# What is the Spanish Financial Transaction Tax (Spanish FTT)?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/transaction-tax/what-spanish-financial-transaction-tax-spanish-ftt

Who is responsible for paying Spanish FTT?
The acquirer of the financial instrument is subject to Spanish FTT. DEGIRO automatically withholds and pays the financial transaction tax.
Which financial instruments are subject to Spanish FTT?
The financial transaction tax applies to shares or similar financial instruments issued by Spanish (resident) companies whose market capitalization is equal to or greater than EUR 1 billion as per 1 December of the previous year. The instrument must also be listed on a Spanish, European or foreign regulated market. For a complete list of the companies subject to this tax in 2021, please consult the following link. (See PDF file attached)
Which transactions are subject to Spanish FTT?
The taxable transaction is the acquisition of the financial instrument or the purchase resulting from the assignment or execution of a position in derivatives. This means, for example, that the purchase of a call option is not subject to financial transaction tax, but the purchase of the underlying share through the exercise of such an option is subject to financial transaction tax.
What is the taxable base and the tax rate of Spanish FTT?
The tax rate is 0.2% (in 2021) and is calculated based on the value of the transaction, where same day (intraday) transactions per financial instrument are compensated.
At DEGIRO we compensate intraday transactions at the end of the day. This means that during the day the transactions will be subject to the above-mentioned tax and the potential (partial) reimbursement will be made once the reference market is closed.

# How is it possible that French withholding tax has been levied while the issuer is listed on the Dutch exchange?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/how-it-possible-french-withholding-tax-has-been-levied-while-issuer-listed

Which withholding tax applies is determined on the basis of the tax residency of the issuer. In case the issuer is a tax resident of France, it is correct that French withholding tax is levied. The exchange where the issuer is listed is irrelevant.

# What information will be shared under CRS and FATCA?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/tax-residency/what-information-will-be-shared-under-crs-and-fatca

Due to the implementation of CRS and FATCA in the Dutch legislation, DEGIRO is obliged to provide the Dutch tax authorities information on its clients and their accounts. The following information may be shared (of private individuals): Name and address;
Tax residence country and tax identification number;

# Why has a lower than expected tax percentage has been withheld on a tax payment?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/why-has-lower-expected-tax-percentage-has-been-withheld-tax-payment

Most likely this has to do with securities lending. It may be that (a part of) your position was lent during the dividend payment. In that case, you do not receive a dividend, but rather a dividend substitute payment. In the WebTrader no distinction is made between a dividend and dividend substitute payment; both are categorized under the description of dividend. A dividend substitute payment is generally not subject to withholding tax. As a result, the total withholding tax paid as a percentage of the dividend presented in the WebTrader can be lower than the statutory rate of the source country.

# What is IRS Regulation 871(m) and what are its implications?

## https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/tax/withholding-tax/what-irs-regulation-871m-and-what-are-its-implications

The IRS regulation establishes a withholding tax on payments that are similar to a dividend (dividend equivalents). The regulation or tax applies to derivatives whose value is derived from underlying US equity securities that pay dividends and only to non-US trading partners. To the extent the product is subject to Regulation 871(m) as of 1 January 2017, a 30% tax rate will be applied to dividend equivalent payments.
